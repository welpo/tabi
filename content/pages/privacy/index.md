## How will we use the data?

The data sent to GitHub is used to display your comment on the site.

The non personal data is used to generate statistics about the site, such as the number of visitors per day, or the most popular pages and referrers. This data is used to improve this demo site and the tabi theme. You can see the statistics generated from this data on the [public stats page](https://tabi-stats.osc.garden/).

All data collected is publically available, either in the form of comments or statistics.

We do not use the data for any other purpose.

The server follows industry best practices for security, including automatic security updates, a strict Content Security Policy, a firewall, key-based SSH access, etc.
