## $\KaTeX$

[$\KaTeX$](https://katex.org/) is a fast and easy-to-use library that enables the rendering of mathematical notation, using LaTeX syntax.

You can use $\KaTeX$ **inline** by wrapping the expression between `$` or between `\\(` and `\\)`.

For example, `$ \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n + 1)!} x^{2n + 1} $` would render: $ \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n + 1)!} x^{2n + 1} $

To display the expression **on its own line and centered**, wrap it around `$$` or between `\\[` and `\\]`.

For example, `\\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} \\]` renders: \\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} \\]

To activate $\KaTeX$ for a post or an entire section, include `katex = true` within the `[extra]` section of the front matter. For exemple:

```toml,hl_lines=5-6
title = "Testing KaTeX"
date = 2002-11-30

[extra]
katex = true
```

You may enable it globally as well, by setting `katex = true` in the `[extra]` section of your `config.toml`.

For enhanced performance and security, the $\KaTeX$ JavaScript, CSS, and fonts are hosted locally.

**Note**: After enabling $\KaTeX$, if you want to use \$ without rendering a mathematical expression, escape it with a single backslash: `\$`.

## Table

Here's an example of a table[^1]. Its colours change depending on the current theme.

| Symbol  | Element | Atomic Number |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| H       | Hydrogen| 1             |
| C       | Carbon  | 6             |
| Fe      | Iron    | 26            |
| Au      | Gold    | 79            |

## Code Block

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!") -> ();
}
```

## Code tags

In Rust, you declare a mutable variable with `let mut x = 5;`, whereas in Python, you simply use `x = 5`. Similarly, to print a value in Rust, you would use `println!("Value: {}", x);`, but in Python, it's as straightforward as `print(f"Value: {x}")`.
