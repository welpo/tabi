## Jump to Posts Feature

When a series has a description over 2000 characters, a "Jump to posts" link automatically appears next to the series title:

##### TODO: Add screenshot with final design

To force the feature on or off, use the `show_jump_to_posts` option in the `[extra]` section of your section (series) or in `config.toml`. This setting follows [the hierarchy](@blog/mastering-tabi-settings/index.md#settings-hierarchy).
