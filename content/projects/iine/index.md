## Why iine?

I wanted to add like/kudos/cheers/appreciation buttons to [my blog](https://osc.garden) without signing up for anything, and making sure my visitors weren't tracked.

Hoping others find it useful, I made the service public (open source) and free forever (at least until it supports over 100k websites).

Built for blogs, portfolios, digital gardens, and anyone who believes the web should be more human.
