## Quick start

Once you have installed Zola 0.17.0 or newer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git
cd tabi
zola serve
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:1111 in the browser.

## Installation

To add tabi to you existing Zola site:

0. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory (if you haven't already):

```
git init
```

1. Add the theme as a git submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git themes/tabi
```

Or clone the theme into your themes directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git themes/tabi
```

### Required configuration

2. Enable the theme in your `config.toml`:

```
theme = "tabi"
```

3. Set a `title` in your `config.toml`:

```
title = "Your Site Title"
```

4. Create a `content/_index.md` file with the following content:

```
+++
title = "Home"
paginate_by = 5 # Set the number of posts per page
template = "index.html"
+++
```

If you want to serve your blog posts from a different path, such as `blog/`, add a `section_path` in the `[extra]` section of `content/_index.md` (this file will need pagination):

```
[extra]
section_path = "blog/_index.md"
```

5. If you want an introduction section (see screenshot above), add these lines to `content/_index.md`:

```
[extra]
header = {title = "Hello! I'm tabi~", img = "img/main.webp", img_alt = "Your Name" }
```

The content outside the front matter will be rendered between the header title and the posts listing. In the screenshot above, it's the text that reads "tabi is a fast, lightweight, and modern Zola theme…".

6. If you want a multilingual site, you will need to set up each language. In `config.toml`, set the title and taxonomies for each language, like:

```toml
[languages.es]
title = "~/tabi"
taxonomies = [{name = "tags", feed = true}]
```

You will need an `_index.{language_code}.md` per language for each section (e.g. /blog or /projects) that you want to enable in that language.

The same is true for individual posts, which should have the exact same name as the default language, with an extra `.{code}` before the extension (e.g. the Spanish version of `security.md` would be `security.es.md`).

This configuration allows the language switcher to take the user to the translation of the current URL. If a translation doesn't exist, the 404 page will be displayed, with an explanation in each language set in the config.

To learn more about multilingual support, see the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/faq-languages/).
