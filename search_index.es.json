Alternativamente, los visitantes también pueden comentar directamente en la discusión o «issue» correspondiente de GitHub.\nAmbas son excelentes herramientas para agregar comentarios a tu blog, pero giscus tiene algunas ventajas:\nMás temas.\nSoporte para reacciones.\nRespuestas a comentarios y vista de conversación.\nMás seguro: utterances requiere habilitar estilos en línea inseguros («unsafe inline styles») para ajustar la altura del frame; giscus no.\nSoporte multilingüe: utterances solo está disponible en inglés; giscus soporta más de 20 idiomas.\nDesarrollo más activo: el último commit de giscus, a fecha de esta publicación, fue hace una dos días. El último commit de utterances fue hace más de un año.\nHyvor Talk es una plataforma de comentarios de pago centrada en la privacidad. Ofrece todas las ventajas de giscus y algunas más, como moderación y detección de spam.\nIsso es un sistema de comentarios de código abierto y autoalojado que almacena los comentarios en su propia base de datos. Una de sus principales ventajas es la privacidad; no comparte los datos de los usuarios con terceros. También tiene una interfaz ligera y limpia, lo que facilita que tus visitantes dejen comentarios. Isso también permite comentarios anónimos, lo que podría aumentar la participación de los usuarios en tu sitio web.\nConfiguración\nSistemas basados en GitHub\ngiscus y utterances requieren una configuración similar. Primero, visita el sitio web del sistema que quieras habilitar: giscus.app o utteranc.es.\nSigue las instrucciones de la sección Configuración del sitio web, y elige las opciones que prefieras. Luego, establece los valores que se muestran en la sección Habilitar giscus/utterances (el bloque de código script) en la sección correspondiente de tu config.toml: [extra.giscus] o [extra.utterances].\ngiscus\ngiscus tiene algunos ajustes más que utterances:\nutterances\nHyvor Talk\nConfigura tu web desde la consola de Hyvor Talk y rellena las opciones en config.toml:\nIsso\nPara habilitar Isso, primero necesitarás instalar y ejecutar un servidor Isso (aquí tienes una guía útil). Luego, completa estas configuraciones en config.toml:\nAjustes comunes\nLa opción enabled_for_all_posts = true habilitará globalmente el sistema de comentarios correspondiente.\nAlternativamente, puedes habilitar los comentarios en publicaciones concretas añadiendo el nombre del sistema (utterances, giscus, hyvortalk o isso) = true. Por ejemplo, así habilitarías giscus:\nSi accidentalmente habilitas más de un sistema, Zola mostrará un error.\nSi tu web tiene múltiples idiomas con publicaciones coincidentes (como esta demo), y te gustaría compartir comentarios entre idiomas, debes usar issue_term = \"slug\" (en el caso de giscus y utterances) o page_id_is_slug = true (para Hyvor Talk e Isso). Esto usará el nombre del archivo Markdown (sin la etiqueta de idioma) como identificador. Todas las demás opciones crearán diferentes secciones de comentarios para cada idioma.\nEjemplo en vivo\nAl final de esta publicación encontrarás el widget de giscus usando los ajustes mostrados arriba.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/comments/","title":"Añade comentarios a tus publicaciones con estas 4 plataformas"},"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/custom-font-subset/":{"body":"El problema\nLas fuentes personalizadas causan parpadeo de texto en Firefox. Para ver un gif y más detalles, mira esta issue.\nLa solución\nPara solucionar esto, tabi carga un subconjunto de glifos para el encabezado. Dado que esto aumenta ligeramente el tiempo de carga inicial, es una buena idea tratar de minimizar el tamaño de este subconjunto.\nPor defecto, tabi incluye archivos de subconjuntos para caracteres en inglés y español (con algunos símbolos). Estos archivos se cargan cuando la página o el sitio de Zola está en ese idioma.\nTIP\nSi estás usando una fuente personalizada, puedes crear tu propio subconjunto (ver más abajo) o desactivar completamente los subconjuntos predeterminados con enable_subset = false en tu config.toml.\nPara una optimización adicional, a continuación verás cómo crear un subconjunto de fuentes personalizado que solo incluya los caracteres utilizados en tu encabezado.\nRequisitos\nInstala estas herramientas:\nfonttools\nbrotli\nEjecuta pip install fonttools brotli para instalar ambas.\nEl script\nEl script que sigue toma un archivo config.toml y un archivo de fuente como entrada, extrae los caracteres necesarios, crea un subconjunto de la fuente y genera un archivo CSS que contiene el subconjunto codificado en base64.\nUso\nGuarda el script en algún lugar como ~/bin/subset_font. Hazlo ejecutable con chmod +x ~/bin/subset_font.\nAhora puedes ejecutarlo con las opciones requeridas --config y --font:\nDe forma predeterminada, esto generará un archivo custom_subset.css en el directorio actual. Usa -o o --output para especificar una ruta diferente:\nColoca este archivo custom_subset.css dentro del directorio static/.\nAutomatización con un Pre-commit Hook\nEs posible que cambies el título o las opciones del menú de tu sitio, lo que haría que el subconjunto personalizado deje de ser útil.\nPara automatizar el proceso de creación de este archivo, puedes integrar el script en un gancho (hook) pre-commit de Git que se active al detectar cambios en el archivo config.toml, ejecute el script y guarde el archivo CSS resultante en el directorio static/ de tu sitio.\nCrea un archivo .git/hooks/pre-commit en tu proyecto de Git, si aún no existe.\nHazlo ejecutable con chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit.\nAgrega el siguiente código al archivo:\nAsegúrate de modificar el script para que coincida con la ruta donde has guardado el script subset_font. Las rutas de configuración y fuente deberían funcionar correctamente con la configuración predeterminada de tabi.\nAhora, cada vez que hagas cambios en tu proyecto de Git y los confirmes, el gancho pre-commit verificará las modificaciones en el archivo config.toml y ejecutará automáticamente el script subset_font para actualizar el archivo custom_subset.css.\nPor cierto, si te interesa una forma de actualizar automáticamente la fecha de tus publicaciones en Zola o comprimir automáticamente tus archivos PNG, echa un vistazo a esta publicación.\nSi deseas utilizar todos los scripts a la vez (compresión de archivos PNG, actualización de la fecha y creación del subconjunto de fuentes), combina su código en un solo archivo .git/hooks/pre-commit.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/custom-font-subset/","title":"Optimiza la carga con un subconjunto de fuente personalizado"},"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/customise-tabi/":{"body":"tabi puede ser personalizado de dos maneras: estableciendo el tema predeterminado (oscuro o claro) y eligiendo el color principal para el tema (“skin”).\nTema predeterminado\nUsa default_theme = \"dark\" para establecer el tema oscuro como predeterminado, o default_theme = \"light\" para establecer el tema claro como predeterminado.\nEstablecer default_theme = \"\" (o no especificar la variable) seguirá las preferencias del sistema del usuario (modo claro u oscuro).\nPara configurar permanentemente tu sitio en el tema oscuro o claro, necesitas desactivar el theme_switcher en config.toml y establecer tu tema preferido (light o dark) como el default_theme.\nPor ejemplo, para tener un tema oscuro permanente:\nSkins\n¿No te gusta el aguamarina? ¡No hay problema! tabi tiene 12 skins (pieles) para elegir.

En esta guía, te explicaremos todo lo que necesitas saber, desde cómo configurar el idioma principal en tu sitio hasta cómo contribuir con tus propias traducciones. ¡Empecemos!\nPreguntas Frecuentes\n¿Qué idiomas admite tabi?\ntabi admite los siguientes idiomas:\nAlemán\nÁrabe\nCatalán\nChino (Simplificado)\nCoreano\nEspañol\nEstonio\nFinlandés\nFrancés\nHindi\nInglés\nItaliano\nJaponés\nOdia\nPersa\nPortugués (Europeo)\nPortugués (Brasil)\nRuso\nUcraniano\nPara una lista siempre actualizada de idiomas soportados, consulta la carpeta i18n en el repositorio de tabi.\n¿Cómo establezco el idioma predeterminado de mi sitio?\nPuedes definir el idioma principal de tu sitio configurando la variable default_language en tu archivo config.toml.\nPor ejemplo, si deseas que el idioma principal sea el Chino, simplemente añade esta línea al archivo config.toml:\nSi el valor de default_language coincide con el nombre de un archivo TOML en el directorio i18n, todos los textos de tabi se traducirán a ese idioma.\n¿Cómo gestiona tabi el soporte multilingüe?\nZola genera automáticamente URLs para cada idioma que no sea el predeterminado de la siguiente manera: {base_url}/{código_idioma}/{post}.\ntabi facilita la navegación entre idiomas añadiendo un conmutador de idioma en la barra de navegación (que sólo se muestra cuando hay más de un idioma habilitado).\nSi subes a la barra de navegación, verás el conmutador de idioma. Al hacer clic sobre él, se mostrará un desplegable con los idiomas disponibles. Si haces clic en el nombre de un idioma, te llevará a la misma página en ese idioma.\nSi una página específica no está disponible en un idioma, tabi mostrará una página 404 con el texto:\nLa página que has solicitado parece no existir o aún no se ha traducido a tu idioma. Revisa la URL en busca de errores o regresa a la página de inicio.\nEste texto se mostrará una vez por cada idioma activado en tu sitio. Puedes ver esta página en acción aquí.\n¿Cómo activo el soporte multilingüe?\nPara habilitar el soporte para varios idiomas, necesitas configurar la variable languages en config.toml. Por ejemplo, si quieres un sitio con inglés como idioma principal que también admita hindi y español, puedes configurar tu config.toml de la siguiente manera:\nEn cada sección de idioma puedes establecer otras variables como taxonomies, description… Consulta la documentación de soporte multilingüe de Zola para más información.\n¿Qué son estos códigos de dos letras?\nLos códigos de dos letras son códigos de idioma ISO 639-1 (o IETF BCP 47, si hace falta), que sirven para identificar idiomas de una manera estandarizada.\ntabi utiliza estos códigos para permitir la navegación entre idiomas y traducir el tema.\n¿Cómo personalizo o reemplazo una cadena de texto específica en mi sitio web?\ntabi busca los archivos de cadenas en el siguiente orden. $base_directory es donde reside tu sitio Zola (donde se guarda config.toml):\n$base_directory + \"i18n\"\n$base_directory + \"themes/tabi/i18n\"\nPor lo tanto, si creas i18n/en.toml en tu directorio base, tabi leerá las cadenas de texto de ese archivo en lugar de las cadenas predeterminadas en inglés. Puedes hacer esto para cualquier idioma, soportado o no.\nAsegúrate de copiar todo el archivo para ese idioma primero, o el tema usará el inglés para las claves faltantes.\n¿Cómo personalizo los formatos de fecha para diferentes idiomas?\nPuedes establecer formatos de fecha específicos por idioma en tu config.toml usando la matriz date_formats:\nEsto permite que cada idioma muestre las fechas según las convenciones locales. Por ejemplo, el español mostrará «3 de febrero de 2024» mientras que el alemán mostrará «3. Februar 2024». Si no se define un formato específico para un idioma, tabi usará la configuración global long_date_format, short_date_format y archive_date_format.\n¿Qué pasa si falta una traducción o está incompleta?\nSi una cadena no se encuentra en el archivo de idioma, tabi recurrirá a la cadena predeterminada en inglés.\nMi idioma no está soportado. ¿Puedo contribuir con una traducción?\n¡Por supuesto! Siempre estamos buscando añadir soporte para más idiomas. Puedes contribuir con una traducción creando una Pull Request en el repositorio de tabi.\nPuedes usar el archivo en inglés como base para traducir las cadenas a tu idioma. Asegúrate de mantener la misma estructura.\nEl archivo debe llevar el nombre del código de dos letras de tu idioma y debe ser un archivo TOML. Por ejemplo, si quieres añadir soporte para el suajili, puedes crear un archivo llamado sw.toml en el directorio i18n.\nNota: cuando pruebes tu traducción, es posible que necesites reiniciar zola serve para ver los cambios, ya que Zola no siempre detecta cambios en los archivos TOML.\nHe encontrado un error en una traducción. ¿Cómo lo corrijo?\nSi encuentras un error en una traducción, puedes abrir un ticket o una Pull Request en el repositorio de tabi.\n¿Cómo actualizo las traducciones después de una actualización del tema?\nSi no personalizaste las traducciones, basta con actualizar el tema.\nSi lo hiciste, tendrás que actualizar manualmente las traducciones. Puedes hacerlo copiando las nuevas cadenas de los archivos correspondientes y pegándolas en tu archivo personalizado.\n¿tabi traduce el contenido de mi sitio?\nNo. tabi sólo traduce el tema. Los posts deberás traducirlos tú mismo.\n¿Cómo puedo mostrar el código del idioma actual en el conmutador de idioma?\nAñade show_selected_language_code_in_language_switcher = true en la sección [extra] de tu config.toml.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/faq-languages/","title":"¿Lost in Translation?

La jerarquía (de menor a mayor prioridad) es la siguiente:\nConfiguraciones globales: Estas son las configuraciones que se aplican a todo tu sitio. Se establecen en config.toml.\nConfiguraciones de sección: Estas son las configuraciones que se aplican a una sección de tu sitio (por ejemplo, /blog o /projects). Se establecen en la metainformación del archivo _index.md de la sección.\nConfiguración de la página «padre»: Para páginas anidadas (páginas dentro de páginas), estas son las configuraciones de la página que las contiene.\nConfiguraciones de página: Estas son las configuraciones que se aplican a una sola página. Se establecen en la metainformación de la página.\nEn todos los casos, las opciones de tabi se establecen en la sección [extra].\nPara las configuraciones que siguen esta jerarquía, el valor establecido en una página reemplaza el valor de una sección, que a su vez reemplaza el valor global. En resumen: cuanto más específica sea la configuración, mayor prioridad tendrá, o página &gt; página padre/sección &gt; config.toml.\nBúsqueda\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\ntabi soporta búsqueda local accesible y multilingüe con Elasticlunr. Para activarla, necesitas:\nEstablecer un default_language en config.toml.\nEstablecer build_search_index = true.\nOpcionalmente, configurar la sección [search].\nPor ejemplo:\nNota: para soporte de búsqueda en Chino/Japonés, necesitas usar una build personalizada de Zola.\nConsideraciones para usuarios de Zola 0.17.X\nZola 0.17.X no proporciona acceso a la variable search.index_format (reporte del bug). Al usar tabi, se asume el uso del índice JSON, que es más eficiente. Sin embargo, debido a otro bug solucionado en 0.18.0, el índice JSON para sitios multilingües no se genera correctamente.\nLos usuarios con versiones de Zola anteriores a 0.18.0 que quieran usar el índice JavaScript necesitan establecer la variable index_format en dos lugares:\nEsto asegura que tabi cargue los archivos correctos. Recomendamos actualizar a Zola 0.18.0 o posterior para una funcionalidad óptima.\nDetalles de implementación\nPara detalles técnicos sobre la implementación de la búsqueda en tabi, incluyendo cuándo se carga el índice, características de accesibilidad y otros detalles, consulta el Pull Request #250.\nSoporte multilingüe\ntabi ofrece soporte multilingüe completo para tu sitio Zola, desde configurar un idioma predeterminado hasta añadir todos los que desees. Consulta la preguntas frecuentes sobre idiomas para más información.\nApariencia\nPágina principal\nLa página principal de esta demo tiene un encabezado con una imagen, un título y una descripción:\nCabecera\nPara configurar la imagen y el título, puedes usar la variable header en el front matter del archivo _index.md de la sección. Por ejemplo:\nLa descripción es contenido Markdown normal, escrito fuera del front matter.\nListando publicaciones recientes\nPara mostrar publicaciones en la página principal, primero debes decidir de dónde se servirán: de la ruta raíz (/) o de un subdirectorio (por ejemplo, /blog).\nOpción A: Servir publicaciones desde la ruta raíz (/)\nConfigura paginate_by en el front matter de tu archivo content/_index.md:\nNOTE\nLa configuración paginate_by va en el front matter principal, no en la sección [extra].\nOpción B: Servir publicaciones desde un subdirectorio (por ejemplo, /blog)\nUtiliza section_path en la sección [extra] de tu archivo content/_index.md:\nALERTA\nNo configures paginate_by y section_path a la vez. Estas configuraciones son mutuamente excluyentes y usarlas juntas puede resultar en que no se muestren publicaciones.\nNotas adicionales:\nEl title en el front matter establece el título que aparece sobre las publicaciones.\nUsa la ruta completa al archivo _index.md de la sección para section_path. Usar section_path = \"blog/\" no funcionará.\nFijar publicaciones\nPuedes fijar publicaciones para mantenerlas en la parte superior de la página principal. En esta demo, esta publicación está fijada, por lo que aparece primera con un icono y etiqueta de “fijada”:\nLas publicaciones fijadas se muestran primero, manteniendo su orden relativo según el sort_by de la sección, seguidas por el resto de las publicaciones.\nPara fijar una publicación, añade lo siguiente a su front matter:\nINFO\nEste ajuste solo afecta a las páginas principales del sitio (como /, /es/, /fr/). Otras secciones como blog/, tags/ o archive/ muestran las publicaciones en su orden habitual.\nWARNING\nCuando se utiliza la paginación (paginate_by), las publicaciones destacadas pueden aparecer dos veces: una vez en la parte superior de la primera página, y otra en su posición cronológica normal en páginas posteriores.\nMostrar la fecha de los artículos en el listado\nPor defecto, cuando se listan los artículos, se muestra la fecha de creación. Puedes configurar qué fecha(s) mostrar usando la opción post_listing_date. Configuraciones disponibles:\ndate: Muestra solo la fecha de publicación original del artículo (opción por defecto).\nupdated: Muestra solo la fecha de la última actualización del artículo. Si no hay fecha de actualización, muestra la fecha de publicación original.\nboth: Muestra tanto la fecha de publicación original como la fecha de la última actualización.\nTIP\nEsta configuración sigue la jerarquía: puedes establecer un valor global en config.toml o configurarlo para secciones específicas en su archivo _index.md. En ambos casos, añádelo a la sección [extra].\nListado de proyectos\nPuedes mostrar una selección de proyectos en tu página principal. Para hacer esto, primero necesitarás configurar el directorio projects.\nUna vez hecho esto, configura la ruta a los proyectos en la sección [extra] de tu archivo _index.md:\nEsto mostrará los 3 proyectos de mayor prioridad (con menor peso; el mismo orden que en Proyectos). Para mostrar más o menos proyectos, puedes establecer max_projects en [extra].\nPor defecto, la sección de proyectos se mostrará en la parte inferior de la página principal, bajo los posts.

El primer color es para el modo claro, el segundo para el oscuro.\nEsta variable acepta cualquier color CSS válido, así que puedes usar palabras clave (por ejemplo, blue), códigos hexadecimales (por ejemplo, #087e96) o valores RGB/HSL (por ejemplo, rgb(8, 126, 150)).\nEtiquetas compactas\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPor defecto, la página de etiquetas muestra las etiquetas así:\nNombreEtiqueta — n publicación[es]\nEstablecer compact_tags = true mostrará las mismas de este modo:\nNombreEtiqueta n\nOrden de las etiquetas\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPor defecto, la página de etiquetas ordena las etiquetas alfabéticamente, dada la configuración predeterminada de tag_sorting = \"name\".\nSi configuras tag_sorting = \"frequency\", se ordenarán según el número de publicaciones (de mayor a menor).\nSeries\nPara una explicación detallada, consulta la documentación de series.\nEnlace para saltar a las publicaciones\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌✅✅✅❌\nPor defecto, aparece automáticamente un enlace “Saltar a publicaciones” junto al título de la serie cuando una serie tiene un contenido de más de 2000 caracteres:\nEstablece show_jump_to_posts = true para forzar la activación de la función y show_jump_to_posts = false para desactivarla.\nIndexación de páginas de series\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌✅✅✅❌\nPor defecto, las páginas de series se indexan (usando una indexación basada en 1) según el sort_by de la sección de series.\nEstablece post_listing_index_reversed = true para invertir el índice.\nIntegración con repositorios Git\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❓❓✅❓❌\n❓: show_remote_source sí sigue la jerarquía y puede configurarse en una página, sección o globalmente. El resto de las configuraciones solo pueden establecerse en config.toml.\nEstas configuraciones te permiten vincular tu sitio web tabi con un repositorio público de Git en GitHub, GitLab, Gitea o Codeberg. Configuraciones de ejemplo:\nEsto habilita dos funciones:\nshow_remote_source = true añade un enlace al código fuente de tu sitio (tu remote_repository_url) que se mostrará en el pie de página:\nshow_remote_changes = true añade un enlace «Ver cambios ↗» al historial de commits del artículo actualizado, al lado de la fecha de última actualización 1:\nAl hacer clic en este enlace, serás dirigido al historial de commits del artículo, donde podrás ver los cambios realizados en él:\nPáginas\nProyectos\ntabi tiene una plantilla integrada para proyectos. Para habilitarla, puedes crear un directorio en content/projects/. Allí, puedes crear un archivo _index.md con el siguiente contenido en el bloque de metadatos:\ntitle es el título de la página.\nsort_by determina cómo se ordenan los proyectos. Puedes ordenar por «date», «update_date», «title», «title_bytes», «weight», «slug» o «none».\ntemplate = \"cards.html\" establece la plantilla para renderizar la página de proyectos.\ninsert_anchor_links = \"left\" añade enlaces ancla a los encabezados.\nshow_reading_time = false oculta el tiempo estimado de lectura.\nquick_navigation_buttons = true muestra los botones de navegación rápida.\nJunto al archivo _index.md, puedes crear un archivo para cada proyecto. Por ejemplo, este es el bloque de metadatos para la página del proyecto tabi:\ntitle es el título del proyecto.\ndescription es la descripción del proyecto.\nweight determina el orden en el que se muestran los proyectos. Cuanto menor sea el peso, más arriba aparecerá el proyecto.\nlocal_image es la ruta de la imagen del proyecto. Esta imagen se muestra en la página de proyectos.\nlocal_image_dark es una variante opcional para el modo oscuro. Requiere que local_image esté configurado.\nremote_image es una URL a una imagen externa, como alternativa a local_image.\nremote_image_dark es una variante opcional para el modo oscuro. Requiere que remote_image esté configurado.\ninvertible_image invierte los colores de la imagen en modo oscuro. Útil para logotipos o iconos en blanco y negro.\nCuando un usuario haga clic en la imagen o el título de un proyecto, será llevado a la página del proyecto. Si prefieres que los usuarios vayan a un enlace externo, puedes establecer link_to = \"https://example.com\" en la sección [extra] del archivo .md del proyecto.\nLa página del proyecto individual se renderiza con la plantilla predeterminada, a menos que establezcas otra, por ejemplo, template = \"info-page.html\".\nFiltrar proyectos\nSi agregas etiquetas a tus proyectos, verás un filtro de etiquetas:\nEl sistema de filtrado de etiquetas utiliza mejora progresiva:\nSin JavaScript: Las etiquetas enlazan directamente a páginas de etiquetas dedicadas (por ejemplo, /tags/nombre-etiqueta).\nCon JavaScript: Filtrado instantáneo, sincronización de URL (#nombre-etiqueta) y navegación por teclado.\nPara desactivar esta función, establece enable_cards_tag_filtering = false en la sección [extra] del archivo projects/_index.md o en config.toml.\nTIP\nPara filtrar proyectos por etiquetas, necesitas establecer etiquetas en el front matter de cada proyecto. Por ejemplo:\nArchivo\nAgregar una página de archivo es similar a agregar una página de proyectos. Puedes crear un directorio en content/archive/. Allí, puedes crear un archivo _index.md con el siguiente encabezado:\nPor defecto, el archivo mostrará las publicaciones ubicadas en blog/. Para personalizar esto, puedes modificar la sección [extra] del archivo _index.md:\nPara una sola ruta: Establece section_path = \"tu-ruta/\" para listar publicaciones de un directorio específico. Asegúrate de incluir la barra inclinada al final.\nPara múltiples rutas: Si deseas agregar publicaciones de varios directorios, section_path puede especificarse como una lista de rutas. Por ejemplo:\nEl archivo muestra las publicaciones en orden cronológico inverso (las más recientes primero). Puedes invertir este orden estableciendo archive_reverse = true en la sección [extra]:\nnota\nLa página de Archivo sólo listará publicaciones que tengan fecha en su encabezado.\nEtiquetas\ntabi tiene soporte integrado para etiquetas. Para habilitarlas, simplemente añade la taxonomía a tu config.toml:\nLuego, puedes añadir etiquetas a tus publicaciones agregándolas al array tags en el bloque de metadatos de tu publicación. Por ejemplo:\nPágina acerca de\nSi deseas tener una página que no sea un artículo, por ejemplo para un apartado “Acerca de”, “Contacto” o “Derechos de autor”, puedes usar la plantilla info-page.html.\nPrimero, crea un directorio dentro de content/ con el nombre que prefieras. Por ejemplo, content/pages/. Luego, crea un archivo _index.md dentro de ese directorio. El archivo debería verse así:\nrender = false indica a Zola que no renderice la sección.\ninsert_anchor_links = \"left\" añade enlaces ancla a los encabezados. Esto es opcional.\nDentro del directorio, puedes crear cualquier cantidad de archivos .md.\nEn esta demo, la página Sobre mí utiliza la plantilla info-page.html. El bloque de metadatos es el siguiente:\nFíjate cómo se establece path = \"about\". Zola colocará la página en $base_url/about/. Si deseas que la página esté disponible en /contacto/, tendrías que establecer path = \"contacto\".\nLa plantilla info-page.html también se puede utilizar para crear lading pages en la ruta raíz (\"/\"). Para hacerlo, el archivo content/_index.md debería verse así:\nSEO\ntabi se encarga de la mayoría de las tareas de SEO por ti (como etiquetas del protocolo Open Graph, descripción, esquema de colores…), pero hay ciertas configuraciones que puedes personalizar.\nFavicon\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nEl favicon es el pequeño icono que aparece en la pestaña del navegador. Puedes establecerlo en config.toml con favicon = \"img/favicon.png\".\nFavicon de emoji\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nTambién puedes establecer un emoji como tu favicon con favicon_emoji. Por ejemplo, favicon_emoji = \"👾\".\nNota: Algunos navegadores no admiten favicons de emoji. Consulta la tabla de compatibilidad en caniuse.\nURL canónica\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅❌❌\nLa URL canónica es una manera de indicar a los motores de búsqueda cuál es la URL preferida para el contenido de tu sitio web. Esto es útil para el SEO y para evitar problemas de contenido duplicado.\nPor defecto, la URL canónica es la URL de la página en la que te encuentras. Sin embargo, puedes cambiar esto configurando canonical_url en el front matter de tu página o sección.\nSi tienes un sitio con una estructura idéntica y contenido coincidente, puedes configurar base_canonical_url en tu config.toml. La URL canónica se creará reemplazando el $base_url de la URL actual con el $base_canonical_url que establezcas.\nPor ejemplo, si configuras base_canonical_url = \"https://example.com\", la URL canónica de la página $base_url/blog/post1 será https://example.com/blog/post1. Esto es útil si tienes un sitio con varios dominios que comparten el mismo contenido.\nNota: para asegurarte de que la URL canónica sea correcta, probablemente sea mejor configurar canonical_url individualmente para cada página.\nTarjetas para redes sociales\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nLas tarjetas para redes sociales son las imágenes que se muestran cuando compartes un enlace en redes sociales:\nPuedes establecer la imagen para redes sociales con social_media_card = \"img/social_media_card.png\".\nPuedes especificar rutas tanto relativas como absolutas.\nRuta relativa: Coloca la imagen en la misma carpeta que tu entrada de blog y especifica su nombre. Por ejemplo, social_media_card = \"relative_image.png\".\nRuta absoluta: Coloca la imagen en una carpeta específica y especifica la ruta desde la raíz. Por ejemplo, social_media_card = \"img/absolute_image.png\".\nSi ambas rutas, relativa y absoluta, son válidas, la ruta relativa tendrá prioridad.\nDado que sigue la jerarquía, si no está configurado en una página, pero sí lo está en una sección, se utilizará la imagen de la sección. Si no está configurado en una página o sección, pero sí en config.toml, se usará la imagen global.\nCONSEJO\nAutomatiza su creación con un script: Automatizando las vistas previas de los enlaces con Zola.\nCreador del fediverso\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPuedes mostrar tu perfil del fediverso en las vistas previas de enlaces de Mastodon configurando la variable fediverse_creator en tu config.toml. Por ejemplo, para @username@example.com, usa:\nNavegación\nBarra de navegación\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nLa barra de navegación es la barra en la parte superior de la página que contiene el título del sitio y el menú de navegación. Puedes personalizar los elementos que aparecen configurando menu en config.toml.\nSoporta links relativos para páginas internas y links absolutos para enlaces externos. Por ejemplo:\nBotones de navegación rápida\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nLos botones de navegación rápida son los botones que aparecen en la parte inferior derecha de la pantalla. Deberías verlos en esta página, si no estás en un dispositivo móvil. Se ven así:\nPara activarlos, establece quick_navigation_buttons = true.\nTable de contenido\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nHabilita el índice de contenidos justo debajo del título y metadatos del artículo con toc = true.\nPara saber más sobre cómo personalizarlo, consulta la documentación sobre la Tabla de contenido.\nEnlace a los artículos anterior y siguiente\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nMuestra enlaces a los artículos anterior y siguiente en la parte inferior de los posts. Se ve así:\nPara activar esta función, configura show_previous_next_article_links = true y asegúrate de que tu sección tiene sort_by (por ejemplo, sort_by = \"date\").\nPor defecto, los artículos siguientes estarán en el lado izquierdo de la página y los artículos anteriores en el lado derecho.\nPara invertir el orden (artículos siguientes en el lado derecho y artículos anteriores en el lado izquierdo), establece invert_previous_next_article_links = true.\nPor defecto, esta sección de navegación tendrá el ancho completo del sitio (igual que la barra de navegación de la parte superior). Para hacerla más estrecha, coincidiendo con el ancho del artículo, establece previous_next_article_links_full_width = false.\nTodas estas configuraciones siguen la jerarquía.\nEnlaces de retorno en notas al pie\nADVERTENCIA DE DEPRECACIÓN\nZola v0.19.0 y posterior puede hacer esto de forma nativa. Establece bottom_footnotes = true en la sección [markdown] de tu configuración.\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\nEstablecer footnote_backlinks = true añadirá enlaces de retorno a las notas al pie de tus publicaciones, como este:\nCuando hagas clic en un enlace de retorno (la flecha ↩), te llevará de vuelta al punto del texto donde se hizo referencia a la nota al pie.\nUsabilidad\nBotón de copiar en bloques de código\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\nEstablecer copy_button = true añadirá un pequeño botón de copiar en la parte superior derecha de los bloques de código, como este:\nNombres de bloques de código clicables\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\nEstablece code_block_name_links = true para habilitan los enlaces clickables en los nombres de bloques de código. Consulta la documentación para ver ejemplos y uso.\nForzar bloques de código de izquierda a derecha\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nPor defecto, los bloques de código se renderizan de izquierda a derecha, independientemente de la dirección general del texto. Establece force_codeblock_ltr = false para permitir que los bloques de código sigan la dirección del documento. Útil para idiomas de derecha a izquierda que necesitan bloques de código de derecha a izquierda.\nSoporte para KaTeX\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\nKaTeX es una biblioteca JavaScript rápida y fácil de usar para la representación de matemáticas TeX en la web. Puedes habilitarlo con katex = true. Mira cómo se ve en tabi aquí.\nSoporte para Mermaid\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\nMermaid es una herramienta de diagramación y gráficos basada en JavaScript. Puedes activarla con mermaid = true.\nPor defecto, la biblioteca Mermaid se sirve localmente. Si prefieres usar un CDN, establece serve_local_mermaid = false en config.toml. El uso de un CDN servirá la versión más reciente de Mermaid; la opción local servirá la versión incluida con tabi.\nConsulta la documentación de Mermaid para instrucciones de uso y ejemplos.\nSubconjunto de fuente personalizada\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nLas fuentes personalizadas causan parpadeo del texto en Firefox. Para solucionar esto, tabi carga un subconjunto de glifos para el encabezado. Dado que esto (ligeramente) aumenta el tiempo de carga inicial, es una buena idea intentar minimizar el tamaño de este subconjunto, o desactivarlo por completo si no estás usando una fuente personalizada en tu tema.\nPuedes crear un subconjunto personalizado adaptado a tu sitio, guardarlo como static/custom_subset.css, y hacer que se cargue con custom_subset = true.\nPara desactivar el subconjunto, puedes usar enable_subset = false.\nPara obtener más información, incluyendo instrucciones sobre cómo crear un subconjunto personalizado, consulta la documentación.\nContenido completo en el feed\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPor defecto, el feed Atom solo contiene el resumen/descripción de tus publicaciones. Puedes incluir el contenido completo de las publicaciones estableciendo full_content_in_feed = true en config.toml.\nOcultar contenido del feed\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nPuedes controlar cómo aparece el contenido en los feeds usando dos configuraciones:\nhide_from_feed = true: Oculta el contenido de todos los feeds (feed principal, feeds de sección y feeds de etiquetas)\nhide_from_main_feed = true: Oculta el contenido solo del feed principal mientras lo mantiene visible en los feeds de sección y de etiquetas\nComentarios\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅❌✅❌✅\nPara activar los comentarios en una página, establece el nombre del sistema como true en el front matter. Por ejemplo, utterances = true.\nSi quieres activar los comentarios de forma global, puedes hacerlo estableciendo enabled_for_all_posts = true en la sección apropiada de tu config.toml (por ejemplo, en [extra.giscus]).\nSi has activado un sistema globalmente, pero quieres desactivarlo en una página específica, puedes hacerlo estableciendo el nombre del sistema como false en el front matter. Por ejemplo, utterances = false.\nLee la documentación para obtener más información sobre los sistemas disponibles y su configuración.\nBotones de iine\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\ntabi soporta botones de iine para mostrar apreciación anónima por tu contenido. Estos botones centrados en la privacidad funcionan sin JavaScript y no rastrean usuarios.\nPara activar los botones iine globalmente:\nPuedes personalizar el icono usado en los botones (esta configuración sigue la jerarquía):\nPara sitios multilingües, puedes unificar los conteos de likes entre versiones en diferentes idiomas del mismo contenido (configuración solo de config; valor predeterminado: true):\nTambién puedes activar los botones iine en páginas o secciones individuales estableciendo iine = true en su front matter, o personalizar el icono con iine_icon = \"🚀\".\nAnálisis web\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue JerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\ntabi ofrece soporte para 3 sistemas de análisis web que respetan la privacidad: Plausible, GoatCounter y Umami.\nPuedes configurarlos en la sección [extra.analytics] de tu archivo config.toml.\nservice: el servicio a utilizar. Las opciones disponibles son \"goatcounter\", \"umami\", y \"plausible\".\nid: el identificador único para tu servicio de análisis. Esto varía según el servicio:\nPara GoatCounter, es el código elegido durante el registro. Instancias auto-alojadas de GoatCounter no requieren este campo.\nPara Umami, es la ID del sitio web.\nPara Plausible, puede ser:\nFormato nuevo (Plausible v3.1.0+): El nombre de script aleatorio sin la extensión (ej. \"pa-XXXXXX\"). Encuéntralo en tu panel de Plausible en Ajustes → Detalles del sitio web → Nombre del script.\nFormato heredado: Tu nombre de dominio (ej. \"example.com\"). Útil si necesitas enviar estadísticas a múltiples paneles simultáneamente; el nuevo formato no admite esta funcionalidad. Consulta la guía de actualización de scripts de Plausible para más detalles.\nself_hosted_url. Opcional. Utiliza este campo para especificar la URL si tienes una instancia auto-alojada. La URL base variará según tu configuración particular. Algunos ejemplos:\nPara GoatCounter: \"https://stats.example.com\"\nPara Umami: \"https://umami.example.com\"\nPara Plausible: \"https://plausible.example.com\"\ndo_not_track: (sólo para Umami) opcional. Cuando se establece en true, se desactiva el seguimiento para los usuarios cuyos navegadores envían un encabezado “Do Not Track”.\nUn ejemplo de configuración para GoatCounter no auto-alojada sería:\nPie de página\nIconos de redes sociales\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlRespeta jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPuedes añadir iconos de redes sociales al pie de página con socials, que acepta una lista de objetos de redes sociales. Por ejemplo:\nPara ver una lista de todos los iconos integrados, echa un vistazo al directorio static/social_icons en GitHub.\n¿Echas en falta algún icono? Si crees que sería una buena adición a tabi, no dudes en abrir un issue o enviar un pull request (ejemplo).\nPara usar un icono personalizado, puedes añadirlo al directorio static/social_icons de tu sitio. Por ejemplo, si añades custom.svg, puedes referenciarlo así:\nNOTA\nTodos los enlaces sociales incluyen el atributo rel='me'. Esto ayuda a los motores de búsqueda y servicios web a verificar que las cuentas de redes sociales te pertenecen.\nIcono de feed\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlRespeta jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPuedes añadir un enlace a tu feed RSS/Atom en el pie de página con feed_icon = true.\nPara usar un icono personalizado, establece feed_icon con el nombre del icono (por ejemplo, feed_icon = \"square-rss\"). El icono debe existir en static/social_icons/ (sin la extensión .svg).\nNota para usuarios de Zola 0.19.X: cuando hay dos nombres de archivo en feed_filenames, solo se enlazará el primero en el pie de página.\nMenú de pie de página\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlRespeta jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPuedes añadir un menú al pie de página con footer_menu, que acepta una lista de elementos de menú. Por ejemplo:\nCopyright\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlRespeta jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPara añadir una mención sobre los derechos de autor a tu sitio web, configura copyright:\n$TITLE será reemplazado por la variable title configurada en config.toml\n$CURRENT_YEAR será reemplazado por el año actual\n$AUTHOR será reemplazado por la variable author\n$SEPARATOR será reemplazado por la variable separator.\nSe procesará el texto en Markdown. Por ejemplo, la configuració de arriba:\nSi tienes un sitio multilingüe y deseas establecer diferentes notificaciones de derechos de autor para diferentes idiomas, añade la traducción correspondiente a copyright_translations.{código_de_idioma} para cada idioma que quieras dar soporte. El código de idioma debe coincidir con el código de idioma de tabi. Por ejemplo:\nMetadatos\nMostrar autoría\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlRespeta jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nPara mostrar la autoría de un artículo, usa show_author = true.\nEsto mostrará lxs autorxs establecidxs en la variable authors = [] en el front matter del artículo. Si esto no está disponible, se usará author = \"\" en config.toml.\nTiempo de lectura\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlRespeta jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nPuedes activar o desactivar el tiempo estimado de lectura de un artículo con show_reading_time. Si lo estableces en true, se mostrará en los metadatos del artículo, así:\nDado que sigue la jerarquía, puedes activarlo o desactivarlo para páginas o secciones específicas. Por ejemplo, esta demo desactiva show_reading_time = false en la sección proyectos en el archivo _index.md, por lo que sus publicaciones individuales no muestran el tiempo de lectura.\nMostrar la fecha\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\nPor defecto, la fecha se muestra debajo del título de la publicación. Puedes ocultarla con show_date = false. Esta configuración sigue la jerarquía.\nFormato de fecha\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\ntabi tiene tres formatos de fecha: long_date_format, short_date_format y archive_date_format. El formato corto se utiliza en los metadatos de una publicación, mientras que el formato largo se utiliza al listar las publicaciones (es decir, en la sección de blog o en la página principal). El formato de archivo se usa para mostrar el día y el mes en la página de archivo.\nPor defecto es “6th July 2049” para los formatos corto y largo en inglés. Para otros idiomas, el predeterminado es \"%d %B %Y\" para el formato largo y \"%-d %b %Y\" para el formato corto. El formato de archivo predeterminado universal es \"%d %b\".\nEn Zola, la sintaxis para el formateo de tiempo está inspirada en strftime. Una referencia completa está disponible en la documentación de chrono.\nFormatos de fecha por idioma\nPuedes personalizar los formatos de fecha para idiomas específicos usando la matriz date_formats en config.toml:\nEsto permite que diferentes idiomas usen formatos de fecha culturalmente apropiados (por ejemplo, “6 de julio de 2049” en español o “6. Juli 2049” en alemán).\nSeparador personalizado\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nEl separador aparece en varios lugares: en el título del navegador, entre los metadatos de una publicación…\nEl separador por defecto es un punto de viñeta (•), pero puedes cambiarlo configurando algo como separator = \"|\".\nOrden del título\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPor defecto, el título en la pestaña del navegador es el nombre del sitio seguido del título de la página. Por ejemplo, el título de la sección del blog es «~/tabi • Blog».\nAl configurar invert_title_order = true, puedes invertir el orden del título del sitio y el título de la página en la pestaña del navegador. Por ejemplo, la etiqueta del título de la sección del blog se convertiría en «Blog • ~/tabi».\nSeguridad\nCorreo electrónico codificado\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\nPara proteger tu dirección de correo electrónico de los spambots, puedes codificarla en el pie de página. Puedes hacer esto estableciendo email en una versión codificada en base64 de tu dirección de correo electrónico2. Por ejemplo, email = \"bWFpbEBleGFtcGxlLmNvbQ==\" es la versión codificada en base64 de “mail@example.com”.\nSi no quieres codificar tu correo electrónico tú mismo, tabi puede hacerlo por ti si configuras encode_plaintext_email = true. Esto te permite establecer un correo electrónico en texto plano en la configuración. Ten en cuenta que esto sólo protege tu dirección de correo electrónico en tu sitio, no en repositorios públicos.\nSi el correo electrónico está codificado (ya sea por ti o por tabi), los usuarios con JavaScript desactivado no verán el icono de correo electrónico.\nCSP (Content Security Policy)\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nLa Content Security Policy (CSP) es una capa adicional de seguridad que ayuda a detectar y mitigar ciertos tipos de ataques, incluidos ataques de Cross Site Scripting (XSS) e inyección de datos. Estos ataques se utilizan para todo, desde robo de datos hasta desfiguración de sitios y distribución de malware.\ntabi tiene una CSP predeterminada que permite imágenes y vídeos remotos, así como incrustaciones de YouTube y Vimeo. Puedes personalizarla con allowed_domains, que toma una lista de directivas de CSP. Esta es la CSP predeterminada:\nEsta función está habilitada por defecto. Para deshabilitarla (y permitir todo), configura enable_csp = false en una página, sección o globalmente. La opción enable_csp sigue la jerarquía.\nPara obtener más información, consulta la página de documentación de CSP.\nIndieweb\nWebmentions\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue la jerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❓❓✅❓✅\nComo se describe en el estándar W3C recomendado, Webmention es una manera sencilla de notificar cualquier URL cuando la mencionas en tu sitio web. Desde la perspectiva del receptor, es una forma de solicitar notificaciones cuando otros sitios web la mencionan.\nPara sitios web estáticos, webmention.io aloja un punto final de webmention que se puede utilizar para recibir webmentions. Esta función recupera las webmentions almacenadas en webmention.io y las muestra para una página. Necesitarás configurar una cuenta para tu sitio web en webmention.io. Cuando habilites la función, anunciará tu punto final de webmention.io y mostrará las webmentions para cualquier página.\nHabilita las webmentions para tu sitio web agregando lo siguiente a tu archivo config.toml.\n❓: Para desactivar las webmentions para una sección o página específica, establece webmentions = false en la sección [extra] del front matter de esa sección o página.\nLa sección de webmentions se ve así:\nh-card representativa\nPáginaSecciónconfig.tomlSigue JerarquíaRequiere JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\nPor defecto, tabi añade una h-card representativa oculta a la página de inicio. Aunque es invisible para los visitantes, está disponible para los analizadores de microformatos. Puedes comprobar la validez de la tarjeta con la herramienta Indiewebify.me.\nPara desactivar la h-card, establece enable = false en la sección [extra.hcard] de config.toml.\nLa h-card predeterminada incluye tu nombre, la URL del sitio web y los enlaces a redes sociales.\nPuedes establecer una imagen de perfil y una pequeña biografía con los ajustes avatar y biography.\nTodas las demás propiedades de h-card se pueden añadir listándolas en la sección [extra.hcard] del archivo de configuración. Simplemente reemplaza todos los caracteres - por _.\nExtendiendo elementos HTML en tabi\nAlgunos elementos HTML en tabi pueden extenderse para admitir casos de uso adicionales, como agregar JavaScript personalizado para comportamientos en todo el sitio al final de la etiqueta &lt;body&gt; o incluir contenido adicional al final del elemento &lt;head&gt; que no esté soportado por otras configuraciones de tabi.\nConsulta la tabla a continuación para ver los elementos que pueden extenderse:\nElementoPlantilla\n&lt;head&gt;templates/tabi/extend_head.html\n&lt;body&gt;templates/tabi/extend_body.html\nNo hay configuraciones explícitas que debas establecer para tu sitio o páginas.

Para más detalles sobre secciones, consulta la documentación de Zola.\nTomando el ejemplo del diagrama anterior, la estructura de directorios sería así:\nPara crear una serie, necesitas:\nUsar la plantilla series.html\nEstablecer series = true en la configuración [extra] de la sección\nActivar transparent = true para integrar las publicaciones de la serie con la sección del blog principal\nLa página principal de la serie muestra un resumen seguido de una lista de todas las publicaciones en la serie:\nSaltar a las publicaciones\nSi el contenido de una serie (el Markdown después del frontmatter en _index.md) supera los 2000 caracteres, aparece un enlace “Saltar a publicaciones” junto al título de la serie.\nPara forzar la activación o desactivación de esta función, configura show_jump_to_posts en la sección [extra] de tu sección de series o en config.toml. Esta configuración sigue la jerarquía.\nPáginas de series y orden\nTodas las páginas en la sección de series serán páginas de serie. Las páginas se ordenarán según el sort_by de la sección.\nAunque las series mantienen su propio orden interno, permanecen independientes del flujo cronológico de la sección principal (por ejemplo, blog/) gracias a la configuración transparent.\nOpciones de orden\nElige entre estos métodos de orden, cada uno con sus ventajas:\nsort_byventajasdesventajas\nslugEl orden de las páginas es explícito en la ruta (por ejemplo, example.com/blog/series1/01-series-post-uno).Cada página de la serie debe tener el prefijo correspondiente.\nweightEl orden de las páginas es fácil de configurar de forma transparente.La primera publicación tiene peso 1, la segunda peso 2 y así sucesivamente.Cada página de la serie debe tener su peso configurado.\ndateEl orden de las páginas se puede configurar una sola vez en la configuración de la sección. No hay que hacer nada en cada página.El orden de las páginas debe invertirse porque la primera página suele ser la más antigua. Esto solo se puede lograr paginando la sección (paginate_by = 9999) e invirtiendo su orden (paginate_reversed = true).\nVersión de Zola para ordenar por fecha\nPara invertir correctamente las fechas, se requiere Zola v0.19.3+ (no publicada) para que la información de paginación esté disponible a través de la función get_section. De lo contrario, cualquier cosa que dependa del orden de las páginas de la serie no será correcta (por ejemplo, página anterior/siguiente, listas ordenadas y no ordenadas…) Ver Zola PR #2653.\nIndexación de páginas\nLas páginas en una serie se indexan empezando desde 1, siguiendo su orden sort_by. Para invertir la indexación (haciendo que la primera página tenga el índice más alto), añade esta configuración a _index.md o config.toml:\nEsta configuración sigue la jerarquía.\nPlantillas de introducción y conclusión\nLos artículos de una serie pueden tener secciones automáticas de introducción y conclusión. Estas se configuran en el _index.md de tu serie. Un ejemplo básico:\nLas secciones de introducción y conclusión tienen sus propias clases CSS (series-page-intro y series-page-outro), lo que te permite personalizar su apariencia mediante CSS personalizado.\nTipos de plantillas\nEl sistema de series usa diferentes plantillas según la posición del artículo en la serie:\nnext_only - Usado para el primer artículo (tiene artículo siguiente pero no anterior)\nmiddle - Usado para artículos con artículos anterior y siguiente\nprev_only - Usado para el último artículo (tiene artículo anterior pero no siguiente)\ndefault - Plantilla por defecto usada cuando no existe una plantilla específica para la posición\nEl sistema determina automáticamente qué plantilla usar según la posición del artículo. Las plantillas se definen en la configuración de la serie (_index.md), como extra.series_intro_templates y extra.series_outro_templates:\nTodas las plantillas son opcionales. La selección de plantillas sigue un sistema de prioridad:\nSi existe una plantilla específica para la posición (next_only, middle, o prev_only), se usará esa\nSi no, se usa la plantilla default\nSi no se define ninguna plantilla, no se mostrará información de la serie\nMira el ejemplo de plantilla para ver un ejemplo más elaborado.\nUbicación en el contenido\nPor defecto:\nLas introducciones de serie aparecen al inicio de tu artículo\nLa conclusión aparece al final (antes de las notas al pie, si las hay)\nPuedes controlar exactamente dónde aparecen usando &lt;!-- series_intro --&gt; y &lt;!-- series_outro --&gt; en tu Markdown:\nVariables\nLas plantillas de series usan un sistema flexible de variables que te permite:\nHacer referencia a información de la serie (título, enlaces)\nAñadir navegación entre artículos\nMostrar indicadores de progreso\nIncluir información personalizada usando tus propias variables\nLas variables son marcadores que comienzan con $ y se reemplazan con contenido real cuando se construye tu sitio. Por ejemplo, $SERIES_HTML_LINK se convierte en un enlace clicable a la página índice de tu serie.\nHay tres tipos de variables:\nVariables básicas de serie: Información general sobre la serie\nVariables de navegación: Enlaces a artículos anterior/siguiente\nVariables personalizadas: Tus propios marcadores para información adicional\nVariables básicas de serie\nVariableDisponibilidadDevuelveDescripciónEjemplo de usoEjemplo de salida\n$SERIES_TITLESiempreTextoTítulo de la serie en texto planoParte de $SERIES_TITLEParte de Aprendiendo Rust\n$SERIES_PERMALINKSiempreTextoURL al índice de la serie[Ver todas las publicaciones]($SERIES_PERMALINK)Ver todas las publicaciones\n$SERIES_HTML_LINKSiempreHTMLEnlace listo para usar a la serie¡Bienvenido a $SERIES_HTML_LINK!¡Bienvenido a Aprendiendo Rust!\n$SERIES_PAGES_NUMBERSiempreNúmeroTotal de artículos en la serieUna serie de $SERIES_PAGES_NUMBER partesUna serie de 5 partes\n$SERIES_PAGE_INDEXSiempreNúmeroPosición del artículo actualParte $SERIES_PAGE_INDEX de $SERIES_PAGES_NUMBERParte 3 de 5\n$SERIES_PAGES_OLISTSiempreHTMLLista ordenada de todos los artículosArtículos en la serie: $SERIES_PAGES_OLISTArtículos en la serie: Artículo actualOtros artículos\n$SERIES_PAGES_ULISTSiempreHTMLLista desordenada de todos los artículosArtículos en la serie: $SERIES_PAGES_ULISTArtículos en la serie: Artículo actualOtros artículos\nCONSEJO: Texto personalizado con permalinks\nLos enlaces markdown como [texto]($SERIES_PERMALINK) serán marcados (y estilizados) como externos.

El proceso tiene dos pasos:\nPrimero, define tus marcadores en la configuración de tu serie (_index.md):\nLuego, en cada artículo de la serie, proporciona los valores para estos marcadores en series_template_variables:\nUso de variables personalizadas\nPuedes usar tus variables personalizadas en cualquier plantilla, junto con las variables integradas:\nWARNING\nAunque los marcadores se definen en mayúsculas ($POSITION), los nombres de variables en series_template_variables deben estar en minúsculas (position).\nEjemplo con variables personalizadas\nEsto generará:\nVariables faltantes\nSi usas un marcador en tus plantillas pero no proporcionas su valor en series_template_variables, la compilación fallará con un error que lista las variables faltantes.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/series/","title":"Guía completa sobre series"},"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/es/blog/shortcodes/":{"body":"Shortcodes de diagramas\nDiagramas de Mermaid\nMermaid es una herramienta de diagramación y gráficos que usa texto y código para generar diagramas. Admite diagramas de flujo, diagramas de secuencia, gráficos de Gantt y más.\nPara incluir un diagrama Mermaid en tu publicación, sigue estos dos pasos:\nEstablece mermaid = true en la sección [extra] del front matter de tu página, sección o config.toml. Esto cargará el JavaScript necesario para renderizar los diagramas.\nUsa el shortcode mermaid() para definir tu diagrama. Por ejemplo:\nEl diagrama se renderizará así:\n&lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\nEl shortcode de Mermaid admite dos parámetros:\ninvertible: Si se establece en true (por defecto), el diagrama se invertirá en modo oscuro, igual que las imágenes invertibles.\nfull_width: Permite que el diagrama ocupe el ancho del encabezado. Mira imagen a ancho completo.\nCONSEJO\nPuedes usar el editor de Mermaid para crear y previsualizar tus diagramas.\nUso\nShortcodes de imagen\nTodos los shortcodes de imagen admiten rutas absolutas, rutas relativas, y fuentes remotas en el parámetro src.\nTodos los shortcodes de imagen tienen los siguientes parámetros opcionales:\nraw_path. Por defecto es false. Si se establece en true, el parámetro src se usará tal cual. Útil para activos ubicados en la misma carpeta que tienen un slug personalizado (ver Zola issue #2598).\ninline. Valor predeterminado: false. Si se establece true, la imagen se mostrará en línea con el texto.\nfull_width. Valor predeterminado: false (ver más abajo).\nlazy_loading. Valor predeterminado: true.\nImágenes de doble tema\nÚtil si deseas usar una imagen diferente para los temas claro y oscuro:\nUso\nImagen invertible\nIdeal para gráficos, dibujos lineales, diagramas… Invierte los colores de la imagen. La imagen de origen se utilizará para el tema claro.\nUso\nImagen atenuable\nLas imágenes con demasiado brillo o contraste pueden ser demasiado discordantes en un fondo oscuro. Aquí tienes un ejemplo de una fotografía que se atenúa cuando el tema oscuro está activo.\nUso\nCambio de imagen al pasar el cursor\nLa imagen mostrada cambia cuando el usuario pasa el cursor por encima. Útil para comparaciones de antes y después, por ejemplo.\nUso\nCambio de imagen vía click\nMuestra una imagen y cambia a una diferente al hacer clic. Ideal para destacar diferencias o llamar la atención sobre detalles.\nUso\nImagen a ancho completo\nLa imagen se expandirá para coincidir con el ancho del encabezado, que generalmente es más ancho que el texto del artículo (excepto en móvil/ventanas pequeñas).\nTodos los otros shortcodes de imágenes pueden usar el ancho completo asignando el valor true al parámetro opcional full_width.\nUso\nShortcodes sociales\niine\nPara añadirlo a todas las publicaciones, establece iine = true en la sección [extra] de tu config.toml.\nEste shortcode te permite añadir botones adicionales de iine.to a tus publicaciones, como este:\n♥️\nUso\nEl shortcode acepta los siguientes parámetros opcionales:\nicon: El icono a mostrar. Puede ser heart, thumbs_up, upvote, o cualquier emoji.\nslug: Un identificador único. Por defecto es la ruta de la página actual. Útil si quieres más de un botón en la misma página.\nlabel: La etiqueta de accesibilidad para el botón. Por defecto es “Me gusta esta publicación”.\nShortcodes de código\nMostrar ruta o URL\nPuedes mostrar una ruta o URL para un bloque de código usando la sintaxis nativa de Zola:\nRequiere Zola 0.20.0 o superior.\nEsto renderiza:\nSi estableces el name como una URL (es decir, comienza con http o https), puedes convertirlo en un enlace clickable. Esto es particularmente útil cuando se usa junto con el shortcode de texto remoto.\nJavaScript requerido\nLa función de URLs clickables requiere JavaScript. Para habilitarla, configura code_block_name_links = true en la sección [extra] de tu página, sección, o config.toml.\nSoporte de shortcode heredado\nEl shortcode add_src_to_code_block sigue funcionando por retrocompatibilidad, pero será descontinuado en una versión futura. Por favor, usa la sintaxis nativa de Zola:\nShortcodes de texto\nAside (nota al margen)\nAñade contenido complementario en los márgenes en pantallas anchas, o como bloques distintivos en móvil.\nNota al margen viene de nota (del latín, ‘marca’ o ‘señal’) y margen (del latín margo, ‘borde’ o ‘límite’).\nEl shortcode acepta dos parámetros:\nposition: Establecer como \"right\" para colocar en el margen derecho (por defecto, izquierdo)\nEl contenido puede proporcionarse mediante el parámetro text o entre las etiquetas del shortcode\nUso\nWARNING\nSepara la llamada al shortcode con saltos de línea para evitar errores de renderizado.\nUsando el parámetro text:\nUsando el cuerpo del contenido e indicando la posición:\nTexto remoto\nAñade texto desde una URL remota o un archivo local.\nEl shortcode acepta tres parámetros:\nsrc: La URL de origen o ruta del archivo (obligatorio)\nstart: Primera línea a mostrar (opcional, empieza en 1)\nend: Número de la última línea (opcional, por defecto es 0, la última línea)\nINFO\nstart y end son inclusivos. start=3, end=3 mostrará solo la tercera línea.\nImportante:\nArchivos remotos VS archivos locales: Si src empieza con “http”, se tratará como un archivo remoto. De lo contrario, se asume que es una ruta de archivo local.\nAcceso a archivos: Dado que utiliza la función load_data de Zola, los archivos locales deben estar dentro del directorio de Zola —ver la lógica de búsqueda de archivos. Desde tabi 2.16.0, el shortcode admite también rutas relativas.\nFormateo de bloques de código: Para mostrar el texto como un bloque de código, debes añadir manualmente las cercas de código Markdown (comillas invertidas) y, opcionalmente, especificar el lenguaje de programación para el resaltado sintáctico.\nUso\nAñade un script de Python remoto dentro de un bloque de código con resaltado sintáctico:\nVisualización de texto de un archivo local:\nMostar sólo las líneas 3 a 5 de un archivo remoto:\nAdvertencias\nDestaca información con estos shortcodes de advertencia/alerta.

Si quieres que esté justo debajo del encabezado (como en esta página), configura esta variable en el front matter de tu post:\nSi prefieres situar la TdC en otro lugar de tu post (por ejemplo, después de una introducción), puedes hacerlo añadiendo una línea con este contenido ahí donde quieras que aparezca la TdC:\nTambién puedes usar el shortcode {{ toc() }}, que simplemente insertará ese texto por ti (idea de Michael Clayton).\nEste método renderizará la TdC sin el encabezado “Tabla de contenido”. Esto te permite usar un encabezado diferente (o ninguno) para la TdC, o incluso ocultarla de forma predeterminada:\nTdC oculta\nEl código para lograr esto:\nNota: Si activas la TdC a través de toc = true y además añades &lt;!-- toc --&gt; en algún lugar de tu texto, obtendrás múltiples TdCs.\nSi colocas la TdC en algún lugar distinto al predeterminado y le añades un encabezado, seguramente quieras ocultar dicho encabezado de la TdC (consulta la sección para ocultar encabezados). Puedes lograrlo así:\nEstableciendo la profundidad máxima\nPuedes establecer la profundidad máxima para la TdC especificando la variable toc_levels, que acepta un número entero entre 1 y 4:\nEn este ejemplo, sólo los dos primeros niveles de encabezados se incluirían en la TdC, independientemente de sus etiquetas HTML reales (h1, h2, h3, etc.). Si quieres incluir sólo el nivel principal de encabezados, establece toc_levels = 1. El valor predeterminado de toc_levels es 3.\nTen en cuenta a tus lectores al establecer toc_levels. Aunque puede ser tentador incluir muchos niveles anidados para una navegación detallada, una TdC más corta y sencilla suele ser más amigable y menos abrumadora.\nOcultando encabezados de la TdC\nEs posible que quieras ocultar ciertos encabezados. Por ejemplo, si tu artículo tiene muchas Figuras o Tablas, éstas podrían saturar la TdC. Puedes ocultar encabezados específicos en la TdC configurando la variable toc_ignore_pattern en la sección [extra] del front matter de tu post.\nEsta variable espera una expresión regular (regex), ya que utiliza el test matching de Tera. El toc_ignore_pattern se prueba contra el texto del encabezado. Por ejemplo, para el encabezado ### Lectura adicional, sólo el texto Lectura adicional se usaría para comprobar si concuerda con el patrón.\nAquí tienes algunos valores de ejemplo para toc_ignore_pattern junto con los encabezados que ocultarían:\ntoc_ignore_patternExcluye encabezados que…\nTablacontengan “Tabla”\n^Figuraempiecen por “Figura”\n(?i)(tabla|figura)empiecen por “Tabla” o “Figura” (insensible a mayúsculas/minúsculas)\n\\[Borrador\\]$terminen con “[Borrador]”.\nPuedes probar tu expresión regular en plataformas como regex101 para asegurarte de que funciona como esperas.\nNota: Las capacidades de “look-around”, incluyendo look-ahead y look-behind, no están soportadas.\nEncabezado 1\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
