They are perfect for static site generators like Zola, since they enable your readers to interact and leave comments on your posts without requiring a traditional backend or database.\nAs they are based on GitHub, giscus and utterances require users to have a GitHub account and authorize the respective app. Alternatively, visitors can also comment directly on the corresponding GitHub discussion or issue.\nBoth are great tools for adding comments to your blog, but giscus has a few advantages:\n\nMore themes.\nSupport for reactions.\nComment replies and conversation view.\nSafer: utterances requires enabling unsafe inline styles to set the height of the frame; giscus doesn’t.\nMultilanguage support: utterances is only available in English; giscus supports over 20 languages.\nMore active development: giscus’ last commit, as of this post, was a two days ago. utterances’ last commit was over a year ago.\n\nHyvor Talk is a paid privacy-focused commenting platform. It offers all of the giscus’ advantages, and a few more, like moderation and spam detection.\nIsso is an open-source self-hosted commenting system that stores comments in its own database. One of its main advantages is privacy; it does not share user data with third parties. It also has a lightweight and clean interface, making it easy for your visitors to leave comments. Isso also allows anonymous comments, potentially increasing user engagement on your website.\n\nSetup\n\nGitHub based systems\nThe configuration of both giscus and utterances is quite similar. First, visit the website of the system you want to enable: giscus.app or utteranc.es.\nFollow the instructions on the Configuration section of the website, and set it up it to your liking. Then, set the values shown on the Enable giscus/utterances section (the script codeblock) on the proper section of your config.toml: [extra.giscus] or [extra.utterances].\n\ngiscus\ngiscus has a few more settings than utterances:\n\n\nutterances\n\n\nHyvor Talk\nSet up your website from the Hyvor Talk console and fill in the settings in config.toml:\n\n\nIsso\nTo enable Isso, you’ll first need to install and run an Isso server (here’s a useful guide). Then, complete these settings in config.toml:\n\n\nCommon settings\nSetting enabled_for_all_posts = true for a comment system will enable it globally.\nAlternatively, enable comments on an individual post’s front matter by adding the name of the system (utterances, giscus, hyvortalk, or isso) = true. For example, this is how you would enable giscus:\n\nIf you accidentally enable more than one system, your site will fail to build with an error.\nIf your site has multiple languages with matching posts (like this demo), and you’d like to share comments between languages, you must use issue_term = \"slug\" (for giscus and utterances) or page_id_is_slug = true (for Hyvor Talk or Isso). This will use the name of the Markdown file (sans the language tag) as the identifier. All other options will create different comment sections for each language.\n\nLive example\nBelow you’ll find the giscus widget using the settings shown above.\n","description":"Discover how to enable a comments section on your posts using giscus, utterances, Hyvor Talk, or Isso, enabling reader interaction and feedback.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/comments/","path":"/blog/comments/","title":"Add comments to your posts with these 4 comment systems"},"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/custom-font-subset/":{"body":"\nThe problem\nCustom fonts cause flashing text in Firefox. For a gif and more details, see this issue.\n\nThe solution\nTo fix this, tabi loads a subset of glyphs for the header. Since this (slightly) increases the initial load time, it’s a good idea to try and minimise the size of this subset.\nBy default, there are subset files for English and Spanish characters (with a few symbols). These files are loaded when the Zola page/site is set to that language.\n\n    \n    \n        TIP\n        If you’re using a custom font, either create your custom subset (see below) or disable the built-in subsets completely with enable_subset = false in your config.toml.\n\n    \n\nHere’s how you can create a custom font subset that only includes the characters used in your header, for maximum efficiency.\n\nRequirements\nInstall these tools:\n\n\nfonttools\n\n\nbrotli\n\n\nRun pip install fonttools brotli to install both.\n\nThe script\nThe script below takes a config.toml file and a font file as input, extracts the necessary characters, creates a subset of the font, and generates a CSS file containing the base64 encoded subset.\n\n\nUsage\nSave the script somewhere like ~/bin/subset_font. Make it executable with chmod +x ~/bin/subset_font.\nNow you can run it with the required --config and --font options:\n\nBy default, this generates a custom_subset.css file in the current directory. Use -o or --output to specify a different path:\n\nYou should place this custom_subset.css file inside the static/ directory.\n\nAutomating with Pre-commit Hook\nYou might change the title or menu options of your site, making the custom subset no longer useful.\nTo automate the process of creating this file, you can integrate the script into a Git pre-commit hook that checks for changes in the config.toml file, runs the script, and stores the resulting CSS file in the static/ directory of your site.\n\n\nCreate a .git/hooks/pre-commit file in your Git project, if it doesn’t already exist.\n\n\nMake it executable with chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit.\n\n\nAdd the following code to the file:\n\n\n\nMake sure to modify the script to match the path where you stored the subset_font script. The config and font paths should work fine with tabi’s default setup.\nNow, every time you commit changes to your Git project, the pre-commit hook will check for modifications in the config.toml file and automatically run the subset_font script to update the custom_subset.css file.\nBy the way, if you’re interested in a way to automatically update the date of your Zola posts or compress your PNG files, check out this post.\nIf you want to use all scripts at once (compressing PNG files, updating the date, and creating the font subset), combine their code into a single .git/hooks/pre-commit file.\n","description":"Learn how to create a custom subset that only includes the necessary glyphs.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/custom-font-subset/","path":"/blog/custom-font-subset/","title":"Optimise loading times with a custom font subset"},"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/customise-tabi/":{"body":"tabi can be customised in two ways: by setting the default theme (dark or light) and by choosing the main colour for the theme (skins).\n\nDefault theme\nUse default_theme = \"dark\" to set the dark theme as the default, or default_theme = \"light\" to set the light theme as the default.\nSetting default_theme = \"\" (or commenting out the variable) will follow the user’s system preference (light or dark mode).\nTo permanently set your site to either the dark or light theme, you need to disable the theme switcher in config.toml and set your preferred theme as the default_theme.\nFor example, to have a permanent dark theme:\n\n\nSkins\nNot a fan of teal?

In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know—from setting a default language for your site to contributing your own translations. Let’s get started!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nWhat languages does tabi support?\ntabi supports the following languages:\n\nArabic\nCatalan\nChinese (Simplified)\nChinese (Traditional)\nEnglish\nEstonian\nFinnish\nFrench\nGerman\nHindi\nItalian\nJapanese\nKorean\nOdia\nPersian\nPortuguese (European)\nRussian\nSpanish\nUkranian\n\nFor an always up to date list of supported languages, refer to the i18n directory in the tabi repository.\n\nHow do I set a default language for my site?\nYou can set the default language for your site by defining the default_language variable in your config.toml file.\nFor instance, if you want (Simplified) Chinese to be the primary language, simply add this line to  config.toml:\n\nIf the value of default_language matches the name of a TOML file in the i18n directory, all of tabi’s text strings will be translated to that language.\n\nHow does tabi handle multilingual support?\nZola automatically generates URLs for each non-default language like this: {base_url}/{language_code}/{post}.\ntabi facilitates the navigation between languages by adding a language switcher to the navigation bar (only shown when there’s more than one language enabled).\nIf you scroll up to the navigation bar, you’ll see the language switcher (the globe icon). Clicking on it will display a dropdown with the available languages. Clicking on a language’s name will take you to the same page in that language.\nIf a specific page is not available in a language, tabi will display a 404 page with the text:\n\nThe page you’ve requested seems to be missing or hasn’t been translated into your language yet. Check the URL for errors or go back to the homepage.\n\nThis text will be shown once for each language enabled on your site. You can see this page in action here.\n\nHow do I enable multilingual support?\nTo enable multilingual support, you need to set the languages variable in your config.toml file. For example, if want an English-default site with support for Hindi and Spanish, you can set up your config.toml like so:\n\nOn each language’s section, you can set other variables like taxonomies, description, whether to generate a feed… Refer to Zola’s multilingual support documentation for more information.\n\nWhat are these two letter codes?\nThe two letter codes are ISO 639-1 language codes (or IETF BCP 47, when necessary). They are used to identify languages in a standardised way.\ntabi uses these codes to allow navigation between languages and translate the theme.\n\nHow do I customise or override a specific text string on my website?\ntabi looks for the strings files in the following order. $base_directory is where your Zola site resides (where config.toml is stored):\n\n$base_directory + \"i18n\"\n$base_directory + \"themes/tabi/i18n\"\n\nSo if you create  i18n/en.toml in your base directory, tabi will read the strings from that file instead of the default English strings. You can do this for any language, supported or not.\nMake sure to copy the entire file for that language first, or the theme will fall back to the default English strings.\n\nHow do I customize date formats for different languages?\nYou can set language-specific date formats in your config.toml using the date_formats array:\n\nThis allows each language to display dates according to local conventions. For example, Spanish will show “3 de febrero de 2024” while German will show “3. Februar 2024”. If no language-specific format is defined, tabi will use the global long_date_format, short_date_format and archive_date_format settings.\n\nWhat happens if a translation is missing or incomplete?\nIf a string is not found in the language file, tabi will fall back to the default English string.\n\nMy language is not supported. Can I contribute a translation?\nPlease do! We are always looking to add support for more languages. You can contribute a translation by creating a pull request in the tabi repository.\nYou can use the English file as a base to translate the strings to your language. Please make sure to follow the same structure.\nThe file should be named after the two letter code of your language, and should be a TOML file. For example, if you want to add support for Swahili, you can create a file named sw.toml in the i18n directory.\nNote: when testing your translation, you might need to restart zola serve to see the changes, as Zola doesn’t always detect changes in the TOML files.\n\nI’ve found an error in a translation. How do I fix it?\nIf you find an error in a translation, you can create an issue or a pull request in the tabi repository.\n\nHow do I update the translations after a theme update?\nIf you didn’t customise the translations, simply updating the theme will update the translations.\nIf you did, you will need to manually update the translations. You can do this by copying the new strings from the corresponding files, and pasting them in your custom file.\n\nDoes tabi translate my content?\nNo. tabi only translates the theme’s text strings. You will need to translate your content yourself.\n\nHow to show current language code on the language switcher?\nAdd show_selected_language_code_in_language_switcher = true in your config extras.\n","description":"Master the art of serving a global audience through tabi's built-in multilingual features.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or start a discussion.\n\n    Table of Contents\n    \n\n\nSettings Hierarchy\ntabi has a hierarchy that allows you to customise your site at different levels. The hierarchy (from low to high priority) is as follows:\n\nGlobal settings: These are the settings that apply to your entire site. They are set in config.toml.\nSection settings: These are the settings that apply to a section of your site (e.g./blog or /projects). They are set in the front matter of the _index.md file of the section.\nParent page settings: For nested pages (pages within pages), these are the settings from the parent page.\nPage settings: These are the settings that apply to a single page. They are set in the front matter of the page.\n\nIn all cases, tabi’s settings are set in the [extra] section.\nFor settings which follow this hierarchy, the value set on a page overrides the value for a section, which overrides the global value. In short: the more specific the setting, the higher priority it has, or page &gt; parent page/section &gt; config.toml.\n\n\nSearch\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\n\ntabi supports accessible, local multi-lingual search with Elasticlunr. To enable it, you need to:\n\nSet a default_language in config.toml.\nSet build_search_index = true.\nOptionally, configure the [search].\n\nHere’s an example configuration:\n\nNote: for Chinese/Japanese search support, you need to use a custom Zola build.\n\nConsiderations for Zola 0.17.X Users\nZola 0.17.X doesn’t provide access to the search.index_format variable (bug report). When using tabi, this variable defaults to the more efficient JSON index. However, due to another bug fixed in 0.18.0, the JSON index for multi-language sites is not generated correctly.\nUsers with Zola versions prior to 0.18.0 who want to use the JavaScript index need to set the index_format variable in two places:\n\nThis ensures tabi loads the right files. We recommend upgrading to Zola 0.18.0 or later for optimal functionality.\n\nImplementation Details\nFor technical details about the search implementation in tabi, including when the index loads, accessibility features, and other specifics, see the Pull Request #250.\n\n\nMultilingual Support\ntabi offers comprehensive multilingual support for your Zola site, from setting a default language to adding as many as you wish. Refer to the multilingual FAQ for more information.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nHome Page\nThe main page of this demo has a header with an image, a title and description:\n\n\nHeading\nTo set the image and title, you can use the header variable in the front matter of the section’s _index.md file. For example:\n\nThe description is regular Markdown content, set outside the front matter.\n\nListing Recent Posts\nTo show posts on your main page, you first need to decide where these posts will be served from: the root path (/) or a subdirectory (e.g., /blog).\nOption A: Serve posts from the root path (/)\nSet paginate_by in the front matter of your content/_index.md file:\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        The paginate_by setting goes in the main front matter, not in the [extra] section.\n\n    \n\nOption B: Serve posts from a subdirectory (e.g., /blog)\nUse section_path in the [extra] section of your content/_index.md file:\n\n\n    \n    \n        WARNING\n        Do not set both paginate_by and section_path. These settings are mutually exclusive and using both may result in no posts being displayed.\n\n    \n\nAdditional notes:\n\nThe title in the front matter sets the header that appears above the posts.\nUse the full path to the section’s _index.md file for section_path. Using section_path = \"blog/\" will not work.\n\n\nPinning Posts\nYou can pin posts to keep them at the top of the main page listing. In this demo, this post is pinned, so it appears first with a “pinned” icon and label:\n\n\nPinned posts are shown first, maintaining their relative order of the section’s sort_by, followed by regular posts.\nTo pin a post, add the following to its front matter:\n\n\n    \n    \n        INFO\n        This setting only affects your site’s main pages (like /, /es/, /fr/). Other sections like blog/, tags/, or archive/ show posts in their normal order.\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        WARNING\n        When using pagination (paginate_by), pinned posts may appear twice: once on top of page 1, and again in their normal chronological position on subsequent pages.\n\n    \n\n\nDisplay the Date of Posts in Listing\nBy default, when listing posts, the date of post creation is shown. You can configure which date(s) to display using the post_listing_date option. Available settings:\n\ndate: Show only the original date of the post (default).\nupdated: Show only the last updated date of the post. If there is no last updated date, it shows the original date.\nboth: Show both the original date and the last updated date.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        TIP\n        This setting follows the hierarchy: you can set a global value in config.toml or override it for specific sections in their _index.md file. In both cases, add it to the [extra] section.\n\n    \n\n\nListing Projects\nYou can showcase a selection of projects on your main page. To do this, you’ll need to set up the projects directory first.\nOnce that’s done, you configure the path to the projects in the [extra] section of your _index.md file:\n\nBy default, this will show the 3 projects with the highest priority (smallest weight; same sorting as Projects page). To show more or fewer projects, you can set max_projects in the [extra] section.\nBy default, the featured projects will be shown after the posts. If you want to show the projects before the posts, set show_projects_first = true.\n\nLight and Dark Mode Switcher\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\n\nThe light and dark mode switcher (the moon/sun icon on the top right) can be enabled by setting theme_switcher = true in  config.toml.\n\nDefault (Light/Dark) Mode\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nThe default theme can be specified with the default_theme variable, which accepts either \"dark\" or \"light\". If you don’t set it, the default theme will be the one set in the user’s browser.\n\nCustom Skins\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\ntabi’s skins change the main colour of the site. You can set the skin in config.toml with skin = \"skin_name\". For example, skin = \"lavender\" looks like this (click to switch between light and dark mode):\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\nExplore the available skins and learn how to create your own reading the documentation.\n\nSans-serif Font\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\ntabi uses a serif font for article paragraphs (the one you’re seeing now). You can switch to using a sans-serif font (the one on the headers/menu) throughout your entire site by setting override_serif_with_sans = true in your config.toml.\nClick on the image below to compare the two looks:\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nExternal Link Indicator\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\n\n    \n    \n        INFO\n        Requires Zola 0.20.0 or later.\n\n    \n\nIf you’d like to add an icon to external links, configure the [markdown] (not [extra]) section in your config.toml:\n\nThis will add a small icon next to external links:\n\n\nCustom CSS\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅❌✅❌❌\n\nYou can load custom CSS for the entire site or on specific pages with stylesheets, which takes a list of paths to CSS files. For example:\n\n\nBrowser Theme Colour\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nThe browser theme colour is the colour that appears in the browser’s tab bar:\n\n\nYou can set it in config.toml like browser_theme_color = \"#087e96\". If you’d like different colours for dark/light mode, you can set an array of colours with browser_theme_color = [\"#ffffff\", \"#000000\"]. The first colour will be used for light mode, the second for dark mode.\nThis variable accepts any valid CSS colour, so you can use keywords (e.g. blue), hex codes (e.g. #087e96) or RGB/HSL values (e.g. rgb(8, 126, 150)).\n\nCompact Tags\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nBy default, the tags page displays tags as:\nTagName — n post[s]\nSetting compact_tags = true will display them as:\nTagName n\n\nTags Sorting\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nBy default, the tags page sorts tags alphabetically, given the default setting of tag_sorting = \"name\".\nSetting tag_sorting = \"frequency\" will sort them by number-of-posts (descending).\n\n\nSeries\nFor a detailed explanation of the series feature, see the series documentation.\n\nJump to posts link\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌✅✅✅❌\n\nBy default, a “Jump to posts” link automatically appears next to the series title when a series has a content over 2000 characters:\n\n\nSet show_jump_to_posts = true to force the feature on and show_jump_to_posts = false to force it off.\n\nSeries pages indexation\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌✅✅✅❌\n\nBy default, series page are indexed (using a 1-based indexing) as per the series section sort_by.\nSet post_listing_index_reversed = true to reverse this index.\n\n\nGit Repository Integration\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❓❓✅❓❌\n\n❓: show_remote_source does follow the hierarchy and can be set on a page, section or globally. The rest of the settings can only be set in config.toml.\nThese settings allow you to link your tabi website with a public Git repository in GitHub, GitLab, Gitea or Codeberg. Example settings:\n\nThis enables two features:\n\nshow_remote_source = true adds a link to the source code of your site (your remote_repository_url) will be displayed on the footer:\n\n\n\n\nshow_remote_changes = true adds a “See changes ↗” link to the commit history of updated posts, next to the last updated date 1:\n\n\n\nClicking on this link will take you to the commit history of the post, where you can see the changes made to it:\n\n\n\n\nPages\n\nProjects\ntabi has a built-in projects (cards) template. To enable it, you can create a directory in content/projects/. There, you can create a _index.md file with the following front matter:\n\n\nThe title is the title of the page.\nsort_by determines how the projects are sorted. You can sort by “date”, “update_date”, “title”, “title_bytes”, “weight”, “slug” or “none”.\ntemplate = \"cards.html\" sets the template to render the projects page.\ninsert_anchor_links = \"left\" adds anchor links to headers.\nshow_reading_time = false hides the reading time.\nquick_navigation_buttons = true shows the quick navigation buttons are shown.\n\nAlongside the _index.md file, you can create a file for each project. For example, this is the front matter for the tabi project page:\n\n\ntitle is the title of the project.\ndescription is the description of the project.\nweight determines the order in which the projects are shown. The lower the weight, the higher the project will appear.\nlocal_image is the path to the image of the project. This image is shown on the projects page.\n\nWhen a user clicks on the image or title of a project, they will be taken to the project’s page. If you’d rather have users go to an external link, you can set link_to = \"https://example.com in the [extra] section of the project’s .md file.\nThe individual project’s page is rendered with the default template, unless you set another one, e.g. template = \"info-page.html\".\n\nFiltering Projects\nIf you add tags to your projects, you will see a tag filter:\n\n\nThe tag filtering system uses progressive enhancement:\n\nWithout JavaScript: Tags link directly to dedicated tag pages (e.g. /tags/tag-name)\nWith JavaScript: Instant filtering, URL syncing (#tag-name), and keyboard navigation\n\nTo disable this feature, set enable_cards_tag_filtering = false in the [extra] section of the projects/_index.md file or in config.toml.\n\n    \n    \n        TIP\n        To filter projects by tags, you need to set tags in the front matter of each project. For example:\n\n\n    \n\n\nArchive\nAdding an archive page is similar to adding a projects page. You can create a directory in content/archive/. There, you can create a _index.md file with the following front matter:\n\nBy default, the archive will list posts located in blog/. To customise this, you can modify the [extra] section of the _index.md file:\n\n\nFor a single source path: Set section_path = \"your-path/\" to list posts from a specific directory. Make sure to include the trailing slash.\n\n\nFor multiple source paths: If you want to aggregate posts from various directories, section_path can be specified as a list of paths. For example:\n\n\n\nThe archive displays posts in reverse chronological order (newest first). You can reverse this order by setting archive_reverse = true in the [extra] section:\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        The Archive page will only list posts that have a date in their front matter.\n\n    \n\n\nTags\ntabi has built-in support for tags. To enable them, simply add the taxonomy to your config.toml:\n\nYou can then add tags to your posts by adding them to the tags array in the front matter of your post. For example:\n\n\nAbout Page\nIf you’d like to have a non-article page for an “About” section, a “Contact” or “Copyright” page, etc., you can use the info-page.html template.\nFirst, create a directory inside content/ with any name you like. For example, content/pages/. Then, create a _index.md file inside that directory. The file should look like this:\n\n\nrender = false tells Zola not to render the section.\ninsert_anchor_links = \"left\" adds anchor links to headers. This is optional.\n\nInside the directory, you can create any number of .md files.\nIn this demo, the about page uses the info-page.html template. The front matter is as follows:\n\nNotice how the path is set to about. Zola will place the page at $base_url/about/. If you’d like to have the page available at /contact/, you’d set path = \"contact\".\nThe info-page.html template can also be used to create landing pages at the path root (\"/\"). To do that, the content/_index.md file should look like this:\n\n\n\nSEO\ntabi takes care of most of the SEO for you (like Open Graph protocol tags, description, color-scheme…), but there are a few things you can customise.\n\nFavicon\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nThe favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser tab. You can set it in config.toml with favicon = \"img/favicon.png\".\n\nEmoji Favicon\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nYou can also set an emoji as your favicon with favicon_emoji. For example, favicon_emoji = \"👾\".\nNote: Some browsers don’t support emoji favicons. See the compatibility table in caniuse.\n\nCanonical URL\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅❌❌\n\nThe canonical URL is a way to indicate to search engines what the preferred URL is for your website content. This is useful for SEO and avoiding duplicate content issues.\nBy default, the canonical URL is the URL of the page you’re on. However, you can override this by setting canonical_url in the front matter of your page or section.\nIf you have a site with an identical structure and matching content, you can set base_canonical_url in your config.toml. The canonical URL will be crafted by replacing the $base_url of the current URL with the $base_canonical_url you set.\nFor example, if you set base_canonical_url = \"https://example.com\", the canonical URL of the page $base_url/blog/post1 will be https://example.com/blog/post1. This is useful if you have a site with multiple domains that share the same content.\nNote: to ensure that the canonical URL is correct, it’s probably best to set canonical_url individually for each page.\n\nSocial media cards\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nSocial media cards are the images that are displayed when you share a link on social media:\n\nYou can set the social media image with social_media_card = \"img/social_media_card.png\".\nYou can specify both relative and absolute paths.\n\n\nRelative Path: Place the image in the same folder as your blog post and specify its name. For example, social_media_card = \"relative_image.png\".\n\n\nAbsolute Path: Put the image in a specific folder and specify the path from the root. For example, social_media_card = \"/img/absolute_image.png\".\n\n\nIf both relative and absolute paths are valid, the relative path will take precedence.\nSince it follows the hierarchy, if it’s not set on a page, but is set on a section, the section’s image will be used. If it’s not set on a page or section, but is set in config.toml, the global image will be used.\n\n    \n    \n        PROTIP\n        Automate their creation with a script: Automating Link Previews for Zola Sites.\n\n    \n\n\nFediverse Creator\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nYou can highlight your fediverse profile in Mastodon link previews by setting the fediverse_creator variable in your config.toml. For example, for @username@example.com, use:\n\nThis adds metadata to your HTML, allowing Mastodon to display the author’s fediverse profile when your content is shared.\n\n\nNavigation\n\nNavigation Bar\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nThe navigation bar is the bar at the top of the page that contains the site title and the navigation menu. You can customise which items appear by setting menu in config.toml.\nThe menu supports both relative URLs for internal pages and absolute URLs for external links. For example:\n\n\nQuick Navigation Buttons\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nQuick navigation buttons are the buttons that appear on the bottom right of the screen. You should see them on this page, if you’re not on mobile. They look like this:\n\n\nThe buttons allow you to quickly navigate through an expandable mini-table of contents, to the comment section (if enabled), as well as to the top of the page.\nTo enable them, set quick_navigation_buttons = true.\n\nTable of Contents\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nEnable the table of contents right below the post’s title and metadata with toc = true.\nRead more about the table of contents and how to customise it by reading the docs.\n\nPrevious and Next Article Links\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nDisplays links to the previous and next articles at the bottom of posts. It looks like this:\n\n\nTo activate this feature, set show_previous_next_article_links = true and ensure your section has a sort_by value (e.g. sort_by = \"date\").\nBy default, next articles will be on the left side of the page and previous articles will be on the right side.\nTo reverse the order (next articles on the right and previous articles on the left), set invert_previous_next_article_links = true.\nBy default, this navigation section will have the full width of the site (same as the navigation bar at the top).\nTo make it narrower, matching the article width, set previous_next_article_links_full_width = false.\nAll of these settings follow the hierarchy.\n\nFootnote Backlinks\n\n    \n    \n        DEPRECATION WARNING\n        Zola v0.19.0 and later can do this natively. Set bottom_footnotes = true in your config’s [markdown] section.\n\n    \n\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\n\nSetting footnote_backlinks = true will add backlinks to the footnotes of your posts, like this:\n\n\nWhen you click on a backlink (the arrow ↩), it will take you back to the text where the footnote was referenced.\n\n\nUsability\n\nCopy Button on Code Blocks\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\n\nSetting copy_button = true will add a small copy button to the top right of code blocks, like this:\n\n\nClickable Code Block Names\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\n\nSetting code_block_name_links = true enables URLs in code block names to become clickable links. Check out the documentation for examples and usage.\n\nForce Code Blocks LTR\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nBy default, code blocks are rendered left-to-right, regardless of the overall text direction. Set force_codeblock_ltr = false to allow code blocks to follow the document’s text direction. Useful for RTL languages needing RTL code blocks.\n\nKaTeX Support\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\n\nKaTeX is a fast, easy-to-use JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. You can enable it with katex = true. See what it looks like in tabi here.\n\nMermaid Support\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅✅\n\nMermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool. You can enable it with mermaid = true.\nBy default, the Mermaid library is served locally. If you prefer to use a CDN, set serve_local_mermaid = false in config.toml. Using a CDN will serve the latest version of Mermaid; the local option will serve the version bundled with tabi.\nSee the Mermaid documentation for usage instructions and examples.\n\nCustom Font Subset\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nCustom fonts cause flashing text in Firefox. To amend this, tabi loads a subset of glyphs for the header. Since this (slightly) increases the initial load time, it’s a good idea to try and minimise the size of this subset, or disable it completely if you’re not using a custom font in your skin.\nYou can create a custom subset tailored to your site, save it as static/custom_subset.css, and have it load with custom_subset = true. Disabling the subset can be done with enable_subset = false.\nFor more information, including instructions on how to create a custom subset, see the docs.\n\nFull Content in Feed\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nBy default, the Atom feed only contains the summary/description of your posts. You can include the entire posts’ content by setting full_content_in_feed = true in config.toml.\n\nHiding Content from Feed\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nYou can control how content appears in your feeds using two settings:\n\nhide_from_feed = true: Hides content from all feeds (main, section, and tag feeds)\nhide_from_main_feed = true: Hides content only from the main feed while keeping it visible in section and tag feeds\n\n\nComments\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅❌✅❌✅\n\nTo enable comments on an individual page, set the name of the system you want to enable to true in the front matter. For example, utterances = true.\nTo enable a system globally (on all pages), set enabled_for_all_posts = true in the correct section of your config.toml (e.g. inside [extra.giscus]).\nIf you have enabled a system globally, but want to disable it on a specific page, set the name of the system to false in the front matter of that page. For example, utterances = false.\nRead the docs for more information on the available systems and their setup.\n\niine Like Buttons\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\ntabi supports iine like buttons for anonymous appreciation of your content. These privacy-focused buttons work without JavaScript and don’t track users.\nTo enable iine buttons globally:\n\nYou can customise the icon used for the buttons (follows the hierarchy):\n\nFor multilingual sites, you can unify like counts across language versions of the same content (config-only setting; true by default):\n\nYou can also enable iine buttons on individual pages or sections by setting iine = true in their front matter, or override the icon with iine_icon = \"🚀\".\n\nAnalytics\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\n\ntabi supports 3 privacy-friendly analytics systems: Plausible, GoatCounter and Umami.\nYou can set them up in the [extra.analytics] section of your config.toml.\n\n\nservice: Specifies which analytics service to use. Supported options are \"goatcounter\", \"umami\", and \"plausible\".\n\n\nid: The unique identifier for your analytics service. This varies based on the service:\n\nFor GoatCounter, it’s the code chosen during signup. Self-hosted instances of GoatCounter don’t require this field.\nFor Umami, it’s the website ID.\nFor Plausible, it’s the domain name.\n\n\n\nself_hosted_url: Optional. Use this field to specify the URL for self-hosted instances of your chosen analytics service. The base URL differs based on your specific setup. Some examples:\n\nFor GoatCounter: \"https://stats.example.com\"\nFor Umami: \"https://umami.example.com\"\nFor Plausible: \"https://plausible.example.com\"\n\n\n\ndo_not_track: (Umami only) Optional. When set to true, the generated tracking script will include the data-do-not-track=\"true\" attribute, which disables tracking for users whose browsers send a “Do Not Track” header.\n\n\nAn example configuration for non-self-hosted GoatCounter would look like this:\n\n\n\nFooter\n\nSocial Media Icons\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nYou can add social media icons to the footer with socials, which takes a list of social media objects. For example:\n\nTo see a list of all the built-in icons, take a look at the static/social_icons directory on GitHub.\nMissing an icon? If you think it would be a good addition to tabi, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request (example).\nTo use a custom icon, you can add it to your site’s static/social_icons directory. For example, if you add custom.svg, you can reference it like this:\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        All social links include the rel='me' attribute. This helps search engines and web services verify that the social media accounts are owned by you.\n\n    \n\n\nFeed Icon\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nYou can add a link to your RSS/Atom feed to the footer with feed_icon = true.\nNote for Zola 0.19.X users: when there are two filenames in feed_filenames, only the first one will be linked in the footer.\n\nFooter Menu\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nYou can add a menu to the footer with footer_menu, which takes a list of menu items. For example:\n\n\nCopyright\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nTo add a copyright notice to your site, set copyright:\n\nYou can use the following variables:\n\n$TITLE will be replaced by title variable set in config.toml\n$CURRENT_YEAR will be replaced by the current year\n$AUTHOR will be replaced by the author variable\n$SEPARATOR will be replaced by the separator variable\n\nMarkdown is rendered. The example above:\n\n\nIf you have a multilingual site and want to set different copyright notices for different languages, you can add the corresponding translation to copyright_translations.{language_code} for each language you want to support. The language code must match tabi’s language code. For example, for Spanish:\n\n\n\nMetadata\n\nShow author\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nTo show the author(s) below the post title, set show_author = true.\nThis will display the authors set on authors = [] in the front matter of the post. If this is not available, it will fall back to author = \"\"in config.toml.\n\nReading Time\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nYou can enable or hide the reading time of a post with show_reading_time. If you set it to true, it will be displayed in the post’s metadata, like this:\n\n\nSince it follows the hierarchy, you can enable it or hide it for specific pages or sections. For example, this demo sets show_reading_time = false in the projects section’s _index.md, so their individual posts don’t show the reading time.\n\nShow Date\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n✅✅✅✅❌\n\nBy default, the date is shown below the post title. You can hide it with show_date = false. This setting follows the hierarchy.\n\nDate Format\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\ntabi has three date formats: long_date_format, short_date_format and archive_date_format. The short format is used in a post’s metadata, while the long format is used when listing posts (i.e. on the blog section or the main page). The archive format is used to display day and month on the archive page.\nThe default is “6th July 2049” for long_date_format and short_date_format in English. For other languages, the defaut is \"%d %B %Y\" for the long format and \"%-d %b %Y\" for the short format. The universal default for the archive format is \"%d %b\".\nIn Zola, time formatting syntax is inspired fom strftime. A full reference is available in the chrono docs.\n\nPer-language date formats\nYou can customise date formats for specific languages using the date_formats array in config.toml:\n\nThis allows different languages to use culturally appropriate date formatting (e.g. Spanish “3 de febrero de 2024” vs German “3. Februar 2024”).\n\nCustom Separator\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nThe separator appears in various places: in the title tag, between the metadata of a post…\nThe default separator is a bullet point (•), but you can change by setting something like separator = \"|\".\n\nTitle Tag Order\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nThe title tag is the text that appears in the browser tab. By default, it’s the site title followed by the page title. For example, the title tag of the blog section is “~/tabi • Blog”.\nBy setting invert_title_order = true, you can invert the order of the site title and page title in the browser tab. For example, the title tag of the blog section would become “Blog • ~/tabi”.\n\n\nSecurity\n\nEncoded Email\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌✅\n\nTo protect your email address from spambots, you can encode it in the footer. You can do this by setting email to a base64 encoded version of your email address2. For example, email = \"bWFpbEBleGFtcGxlLmNvbQ==\" is the base64 encoded version of “mail@example.com”.\nIf you don’t want to encode your email yourself, tabi can encode it for you if you set encode_plaintext_email = true. This allows you to set a plaintext email on the config. Note that this only protects your email address on your site, not in public repositories.\nIf the email is encoded (either by you or by tabi), users with JavaScript disabled will not see the email icon.\n\nCSP (Content Security Policy)\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nContent Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of malware.\ntabi has a default CSP that allows for remote images and videos, as well as YouTube and Vimeo embeds. You can customise it with allowed_domains, which takes a list of CSP directives. This is the default CSP:\n\nThis feature is enabled by default. To disable it (and allow all connections), set enable_csp = false on a page, section or globally. The enable_csp setting follows the hierarchy.\nSee the CSP documentation page for more information.\n\n\nIndieweb\n\nWebmentions\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❓❓✅❓✅\n\nAs described by the recommended W3C standard Webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site. From the receiver’s perspective, it’s a way to request notifications when other sites mention it.\nFor static sites webmention.io hosts a webmention endpoint that can be used to receive webmentions. This feature fetches the webmentions stored at webmention.io and displays them for a page. You will need to have setup an account for your website at webmention.io. When you enable the webmention feature it will advertise your webmention.io endpoint and display the webmentions for all posts.\nEnable webmentions for your site by adding the following to your config.toml file.\n\n❓: To disable webmentions for a specific section or page, set webmentions = false in the [extra] section of that section or page’s front matter.\nThe webmentions section looks like this:\n\n\nRepresentative h-card\nPageSectionconfig.tomlFollows HierarchyRequires JavaScript\n❌❌✅❌❌\n\nBy default, tabi adds a hidden representative h-card to the homepage. While invisible to visitors, it’s available to microformat parsers. You can check the validity of the card with the Indiewebify.me tool.\nTo disable the h-card, set enable = false in the [extra.hcard] section of config.toml.\nThe default h-card includes your name, website url and social media links.\nYou can set a profile picture and a small bio with the avatar and biography settings.\nAll other h-card properties can be added by listing them under the [extra.hcard]section of the config file. Simply replace all - characters by _.\n\n\nExtending HTML Elements in tabi\nSome HTML elements in tabi can be extended to support additional use cases such as adding custom JavaScript for site-wide behavior at the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag or including additional content at the end of the &lt;head&gt; element that is not otherwise supported by other tabi settings.\nSee the table below for elements that can be extended:\nElementTemplate\n&lt;head&gt;templates/tabi/extend_head.html\n&lt;body&gt;templates/tabi/extend_body.html\n\nThere are no explicit settings to configure for your site or pages. Simply create the relevant template file for your site, and tabi will automatically include it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a remote Git repository, you might want to automate the process of updating the updated field.

Unlike tags, which simply group related content, series suggest a specific reading order from start to finish.\nPosts within a series do not need to be published consecutively; the series feature brings together thematically linked posts in a coherent sequence.\nThe diagram below illustrates how series posts (3, 5, and 8) exist within the main blog flow while maintaining their own ordered sequence within Series 1.\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\nCreate a directory for your series.\n\n\nCreate _index.md in the series directory.\n\n\nSet up the _index.md front matter:\n\n\n\nCreate your series articles in this directory.\n\n\nWant more? Keep reading!\n\nHow Do Series Work?\nA series is just a section which is handled in a special way by tabi. For more details on sections, see the Zola documentation.\nTaking the example from the diagram above, the directory structure would be as follow:\n\nTo create a series, you need to:\n\nUse the series.html template\nSet series = true in the section’s [extra] configuration\nEnable transparent = true to integrate series posts with the parent blog section\n\nThe series main page displays an overview followed by a list of all posts in the series:\n\n\nJump to Posts\nIf the content of a series (the Markdown after the front matter in _index.md) is over 2000 characters, a “Jump to posts” link appears next to the series title.\n\n\nTo force the feature on or off, set show_jump_to_posts in the [extra] section of your series section or in config.toml. This setting follows the hierarchy.\n\nSeries Pages and Order\nAll pages in the series section will be a series page. The series pages will be ordered as per the series section sort_by.\nWhile series maintain their own internal order, they remain independent from the main section’s (e.g. blog/) chronological flow thanks to the transparent setting.\n\nSorting Options\nChoose from these sorting methods, each with its own advantages:\n\n    sort_byproscons\nslugThe series pages order is made explicit in the path (e.g. example.com/blog/series1/01-series-post-one).Each series page must be prefixed accordingly.\nweightThe series pages order is easy to set up transparently.First series post has weight 1, second series post has weight 2 and so on.Each series page must have its weight set accordingly.\ndateThe series pages order can be configured once in the series section configuration. No need to do anything on each series page.The series pages order has to be reversed because the first page is usually the oldest. This can only be achieved by paginating the series section (paginate_by = 9999) and reversing its order (paginate_reversed = true).\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        Zola version to sort by date\n        In order to properly reverse dates, Zola v0.19.3+ (unreleased) is required so that pagination information is available through the get_section function. Anything relying on the series pages order won’t be correct in a series page otherwise (e.g. previous/next series page, ordered and unordered list…) See Zola PR #2653.\n\n    \n\n\nPage Indexing\nPages in a series are indexed starting from 1, following their sort_by order. To reverse the indexing (making the first page have the highest index instead), add this setting to _index.md or config.toml:\n\n\n\nThis setting follows the hierarchy.\n\nIntro and Outro Templates\nSeries articles can have automatic introduction and conclusion sections. These are configured in your series’ _index.md. A basic example:\n\nThe intro and outro sections each have their own CSS classes (series-page-intro and series-page-outro), allowing you to customize their appearance through custom CSS.\n\nTemplate Types\nThe series system uses different templates based on an article’s position in the series:\n\nnext_only - Used for the first article (has next article but no previous)\nmiddle - Used for articles with both previous and next articles\nprev_only - Used for the last article (has previous article but no next)\ndefault - Fallback template used when a specific position template isn’t defined\n\nThe system automatically determines which template to use based on the article’s position. The templates are defined in the series configuration (_index.md), as extra.series_intro_templates and extra.series_outro_templates.:\n\nAll templates are optional. Template selection follows a priority system:\n\nIf a position-specific template exists (next_only, middle, or prev_only), it will be used\nOtherwise, the default template is used\nIf no templates are defined at all, no series information will be displayed\n\nSee the template example for a more elaborate example.\n\nPlacement in Content\nBy default:\n\nSeries introductions appear at the start of your article\nSeries outro appears at the end (before footnotes, if any)\n\nYou can control exactly where these appear using &lt;!-- series_intro --&gt; and &lt;!-- series_outro --&gt; in your Markdown:\n\n\nVariables\nSeries templates use a flexible variable system that lets you:\n\nReference series information (title, links)\nAdd navigation between articles\nShow progress indicators\nInclude custom information using your own variables\n\nVariables are placeholders starting with $ that get replaced with actual content when your site builds. For example, $SERIES_HTML_LINK becomes a clickable link to your series index page.\nThere are three types of variables:\n\nBasic Series Variables: General information about the series\nNavigation Variables: Links to previous/next articles\nCustom Variables: Your own placeholders for additional information\n\n\nBasic Series Variables\n\n    VariableAvailabilityReturnsDescriptionExample UsageExample Output\n$SERIES_TITLEAlwaysTextPlain text title of the seriesPart of $SERIES_TITLEPart of Learn Rust\n$SERIES_PERMALINKAlwaysTextURL to series index[See all posts]($SERIES_PERMALINK)See all posts\n$SERIES_HTML_LINKAlwaysHTMLReady-to-use link to seriesWelcome to $SERIES_HTML_LINK!Welcome to Learn Rust!\n$SERIES_PAGES_NUMBERAlwaysNumberTotal articles in seriesA $SERIES_PAGES_NUMBER part seriesA 5 part series\n$SERIES_PAGE_INDEXAlwaysNumberCurrent article’s positionPart $SERIES_PAGE_INDEX of $SERIES_PAGES_NUMBERPart 3 of 5\n$SERIES_PAGES_OLISTAlwaysHTMLOrdered list of all articlesArticles in series: $SERIES_PAGES_OLISTArticles in series: Current articleOther articles\n$SERIES_PAGES_ULISTAlwaysHTMLUnordered list of all articlesArticles in series: $SERIES_PAGES_ULISTArticles in series: Current articleOther articles\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        TIP: Custom text with permalinks\n        Markdown links like [text]($SERIES_PERMALINK) will be marked (and styled) as external.

Whether you want to display images that adapt to light and dark themes, or format a professional-looking reference section, these custom shortcodes have got you covered.","id":"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/shortcodes/","path":"/blog/shortcodes/","title":"Custom shortcodes"},"https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/toc/":{"body":"\nDocumentation\n\nEnabling (and positioning) the Table of Contents\nThere are two ways to enable the Table of Contents (ToC). If you want it to be right below the header (like in this page) set this variable on the post’s front matter:\n\nIf you’d rather show the ToC elsewhere on your post (e.g. after an introduction), you can do so by adding a line with this content wherever you’d like the ToC to appear:\n\nYou can also use the simple {{ toc() }} shortcode, which will simply write that string for you, effectively inserting the ToC (Michael Clayton’s idea).\nThis method will render the ToC without the “Table of Contents” header. This allows you to use a different (or no) header for the ToC, or hide it like this:\n\n    Hidden ToC\n    \n\nThe code to achieve this:\n\nNote: If you both set toc = true and have &lt;!-- toc --&gt; somewhere in your text, you’ll get multiple ToCs.\nIf you set a custom position and a custom header for the ToC, you’ll probably want to hide it (see the section below) like this:\n\n\nSetting a maximum depth\nYou can set the maximum depth for the ToC by specifying the toc_levels variable, which takes an integer between 1 and 4:\n\nIn this example, only the first two levels of headers would be included in the ToC, regardless of their actual HTML tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.). If you want to include only the main level of headers, set toc_levels = 1. The default toc_levels value is 3.\nKeep your readers in mind when setting the toc_levels. While it can be tempting to include many nested levels for detailed navigation, a shorter and simpler ToC can often be more reader-friendly and less overwhelming. Adjust the depth according to the complexity and length of your content for the best reader experience.\n\nHiding headers from the ToC\nYou might want to hide certain headers. For example, if your article has many Figures or Tables, they might clutter the ToC. You can hide specific headers in the ToC with the toc_ignore_pattern variable.\nThis variable expects a regular expression (regex), as it’s using Tera’s matching test. The toc_ignore_pattern is tested against the text of the header, excluding the # character(s). For example, for the header ### Further reading, the text Further reading would be checked against.\nHere are some example values for toc_ignore_pattern along with the headers they can hide:\ntoc_ignore_patternExcludes headers which…\nTablecontain “Table”\n^Figurestart with “Figure”\n(?i)(table|figure)start with “Table” or “Figure” (case insensitive)\n\\[Draft\\]$end with “[Draft]”.\n\nYou can test your regular expression on a site like regex101 to ensure it works as expected.\nNote: “Look-around” capabilities, including look-ahead and look-behind, are not supported.\n\nHeading 1\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
